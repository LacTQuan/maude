user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python test file as input.
Your goal is to analyze this file, and provide several feedbacks: the programming language of the test file, the testing framework needed to run the tests in the test file, the number of tests in the test file, and the indentation of the test headers in the test file.

Here is the file that contains the existing tests, called `test/test_app.py`:

Now, you need to analyze the test file and provide a YAML object equivalent to type $TestsAnalysis, according to the following Pydantic definitions:
=====

class TestsAnalysis(BaseModel):
    language: str = Field(description="The programming language used by the test file")
    testing_framework: str = Field(description="The testing framework needed to run the tests in the test file")
    number_of_tests: int = Field(description="The number of tests in the test file")
    test_headers_indentation: int = Field(description="The indentation of the test headers in the test file.For example, "def test_..." has an indentation of 0, "  def test_..." has an indentation of 2, "    def test_..." has an indentation of 4, and so on.")

=====


Example output:

```yaml
language: python
testing_framework: ...
number_of_tests: ...
test_headers_indentation: ...
```

The Response should be only a valid YAML object, without any introduction text or follow-up text.

Answer:
```yaml

system: 
user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python test file as input.
Your goal is to analyze this file and provide the following: 
* The programming language of the test file
* The testing framework needed to run the tests in the test file
* The number of tests in the test file
* The line number in the test file where the new test should be inserted. 

IMPORTANT: Ensure that you account for block delimiters (e.g., curly braces in Java, `end` in Ruby) to correctly place the new test before the end of the relevant block, such as a class or method definition. If a test should live within a class then the insertion happens BEFORE the last delimiter (if relevant).

Here is the file that contains the existing tests, called `test/test_app.py`. Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the structure of the file. Those numbers are not a part of the original code.

Now, you need to analyze the test file and provide a YAML object equivalent to type $TestsAnalysis, according to the following Pydantic definitions:
=====
class TestsAnalysis(BaseModel):
    language: str = Field(description="The programming language used by the test file")
    testing_framework: str = Field(description="The testing framework needed to run the tests in the test file")
    number_of_tests: int = Field(description="The number of tests in the test file")
    relevant_line_number_to_insert_tests_after: int = Field(description="The line number in the test file, **after which** the new tests should be inserted, so they will be a part of the existing test suite. Place the new tests after the last test in the suite.")
    relevant_line_number_to_insert_imports_after: int = Field(description="The line number in the test file, **after which**  new imports should be inserted, so they will be a legal valid code, and the new test file will be able to run. The new imports should be introduced as independent import lines, and not as part of the existing imports.")
=====


Example output:

```yaml
language: python
testing_framework: ...
number_of_tests: ...
relevant_line_number_to_insert_tests_after: ...
relevant_line_number_to_insert_imports_after: ...
```

## Additional Instructions
======
However, do not assert exception messages or any string-based messages in assertions, as these may lead to test failures due to minor variations.
======


The Response should be only a valid YAML object, without any introduction text or follow-up text.

Answer:
```yaml

user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Step by step carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.
- You may need to use **Equivalent Partitioning** strategy to cover as many test scenarios as possible and reduce the number of test cases while maintaing good code coverage.
- There are some cases that result multiple correct answers, you should consider it carefully and define the assertions not so strictly.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `src/app.py`.
Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the code coverage report.
Those numbers are not a part of the original code.

### Test Framework
The test framework used for running tests is `pytest`.
If the current tests are part of a class and contain a 'self' input, than the generated tests should also include the `self` parameter in the test function signature.


## Additional Instructions
======
However, do not assert exception messages or any string-based messages in assertions, as these may lead to test failures due to minor variations.
======



## Code Coverage
Based on the code coverage report below, your goal is to suggest new test cases for the test file `test/test_app.py` against the source file `src/app.py` that would increase the coverage, meaning cover missing lines of code.
=========
Lines covered: [7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 38, 40, 41, 42, 44, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 61, 62, 64, 71, 72, 73, 75, 76, 79, 80, 81, 83, 86, 87, 88, 89, 91, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 109, 110, 112, 117, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 127, 129, 130, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 145, 151, 153, 155, 156, 158, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 169]

user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Step by step carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.
- You may need to use **Equivalent Partitioning** strategy to cover as many test scenarios as possible and reduce the number of test cases while maintaing good code coverage.
- There are some cases that result multiple correct answers, you should consider it carefully and define the assertions not so strictly.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `src/app.py`.
Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the code coverage report.
Those numbers are not a part of the original code.

### Test Framework
The test framework used for running tests is `pytest`.
If the current tests are part of a class and contain a 'self' input, than the generated tests should also include the `self` parameter in the test function signature.

## Results of Mutation Testing
**Mutation Score**: 25.00%
**Nodes Covered**: 0/0
The following mutants **survived**:
1) line 176, operator: Arithmetic Operator Replacement
2) line 180, operator: Arithmetic Operator Replacement
3) line 183, operator: Arithmetic Operator Replacement
4) line 197, operator: Unknown operator
5) line 27, operator: Logical Connector Replacement
6) line 169, operator: Relational Operator Replacement

**Goal**: Please generate or refine tests so that these surviving mutants are killed.
Focus on the lines and operators that survived. For each, we need a test scenario that fails if that mutation occurs.




## Additional Instructions
======
However, do not assert exception messages or any string-based messages in assertions, as these may lead to test failures due to minor variations.
======



## Code Coverage
Based on the code coverage report below, your goal is to suggest new test cases for the test file `test/test_app.py` against the source file `src/app.py` that would increase the coverage, meaning cover missing lines of code.
=========
Lines covered: [7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 38, 40, 41, 42, 44, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 61, 62, 64, 71, 72, 73, 75, 76, 79, 80, 81, 83, 86, 87, 88, 89, 91, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 109, 110, 112, 117, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 127, 129, 130, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 145, 151, 153, 155, 156, 158, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 169]

user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Step by step carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.
- You may need to use **Equivalent Partitioning** strategy to cover as many test scenarios as possible and reduce the number of test cases while maintaing good code coverage.
- There are some cases that result multiple correct answers, you should consider it carefully and define the assertions not so strictly.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `src/app.py`.
Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the code coverage report.
Those numbers are not a part of the original code.

### Test Framework
The test framework used for running tests is `pytest`.
If the current tests are part of a class and contain a 'self' input, than the generated tests should also include the `self` parameter in the test function signature.

## Results of Mutation Testing
**Mutation Score**: 46.15%
**Nodes Covered**: 0/0
The following mutants **survived**:
1) line 50, operator: Arithmetic Operator Replacement
2) line 50, operator: Arithmetic Operator Replacement
3) line 182, operator: Arithmetic Operator Replacement
4) line 183, operator: Arithmetic Operator Replacement
5) line 122, operator: Break Continue Replacement
6) line 54, operator: Relational Operator Replacement
7) line 54, operator: Relational Operator Replacement

**Goal**: Please generate or refine tests so that these surviving mutants are killed.
Focus on the lines and operators that survived. For each, we need a test scenario that fails if that mutation occurs.




## Additional Instructions
======
However, do not assert exception messages or any string-based messages in assertions, as these may lead to test failures due to minor variations.
======



## Code Coverage
Based on the code coverage report below, your goal is to suggest new test cases for the test file `test/test_app.py` against the source file `src/app.py` that would increase the coverage, meaning cover missing lines of code.
=========
Lines covered: [7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 38, 40, 41, 42, 44, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 61, 62, 64, 71, 72, 73, 75, 76, 79, 80, 81, 83, 86, 87, 88, 89, 91, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 109, 110, 112, 117, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 127, 129, 130, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 145, 151, 153, 155, 156, 158, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 169]

user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Step by step carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.
- You may need to use **Equivalent Partitioning** strategy to cover as many test scenarios as possible and reduce the number of test cases while maintaing good code coverage.
- There are some cases that result multiple correct answers, you should consider it carefully and define the assertions not so strictly.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `src/app.py`.
Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the code coverage report.
Those numbers are not a part of the original code.

### Test Framework
The test framework used for running tests is `pytest`.
If the current tests are part of a class and contain a 'self' input, than the generated tests should also include the `self` parameter in the test function signature.

## Results of Mutation Testing
**Mutation Score**: 33.33%
**Nodes Covered**: 0/0
The following mutants **survived**:
1) line 50, operator: Arithmetic Operator Deletion
2) line 97, operator: Arithmetic Operator Replacement
3) line 177, operator: Arithmetic Operator Replacement
4) line 122, operator: Break Continue Replacement

**Goal**: Please generate or refine tests so that these surviving mutants are killed.
Focus on the lines and operators that survived. For each, we need a test scenario that fails if that mutation occurs.




## Additional Instructions
======
However, do not assert exception messages or any string-based messages in assertions, as these may lead to test failures due to minor variations.
======



## Code Coverage
Based on the code coverage report below, your goal is to suggest new test cases for the test file `test/test_app.py` against the source file `src/app.py` that would increase the coverage, meaning cover missing lines of code.
=========
Lines covered: [7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 38, 40, 41, 42, 44, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 61, 62, 64, 71, 72, 73, 75, 76, 79, 80, 81, 83, 86, 87, 88, 89, 91, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 109, 110, 112, 117, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 127, 129, 130, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 145, 151, 153, 155, 156, 158, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 169]

user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Step by step carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.
- You may need to use **Equivalent Partitioning** strategy to cover as many test scenarios as possible and reduce the number of test cases while maintaing good code coverage.
- There are some cases that result multiple correct answers, you should consider it carefully and define the assertions not so strictly.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `src/app.py`.
Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the code coverage report.
Those numbers are not a part of the original code.

### Test Framework
The test framework used for running tests is `pytest`.
If the current tests are part of a class and contain a 'self' input, than the generated tests should also include the `self` parameter in the test function signature.

## Results of Mutation Testing
**Mutation Score**: 33.33%
**Nodes Covered**: 0/0
The following mutants **survived**:
1) line 50, operator: Arithmetic Operator Deletion
2) line 99, operator: Arithmetic Operator Replacement
3) line 84, operator: Break Continue Replacement
4) line 102, operator: Break Continue Replacement
5) line 122, operator: Break Continue Replacement
6) line 169, operator: Relational Operator Replacement

**Goal**: Please generate or refine tests so that these surviving mutants are killed.
Focus on the lines and operators that survived. For each, we need a test scenario that fails if that mutation occurs.




## Additional Instructions
======
However, do not assert exception messages or any string-based messages in assertions, as these may lead to test failures due to minor variations.
======



## Code Coverage
Based on the code coverage report below, your goal is to suggest new test cases for the test file `test/test_app.py` against the source file `src/app.py` that would increase the coverage, meaning cover missing lines of code.
=========
Lines covered: [7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 38, 40, 41, 42, 44, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 61, 62, 64, 71, 72, 73, 75, 76, 79, 80, 81, 83, 86, 87, 88, 89, 91, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 109, 110, 112, 117, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 127, 129, 130, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 145, 151, 153, 155, 156, 158, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 169]
Lines missed: [84, 171, 172, 173, 176, 177, 180, 181, 182, 183, 186, 187, 189, 190, 191, 192, 194, 195, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202, 204]
Percentage covered: 80.47%

## Response
The output must be a YAML object equivalent to type $NewTests, according to the following Pydantic definitions:
=====
class SingleTest(BaseModel):
    test_behavior: str = Field(description="Short description of the behavior the test covers")
    lines_to_cover: str = Field(description="A list of line numbers, currently uncovered, that this specific new test aims to cover")
    test_name: str = Field(description=" A short test name, in snake case, that reflects the behaviour to test")
    test_code: str = Field(description="A new 'pytest' test function that extends the existing test suite, and tests the behavior described in 'test_behavior'. The test should be a written like its a part of the existing test suite, if there is one, and it can use existing helper functions, setup, or teardown code. Don't iclude new imports here, use 'new_imports_code' section instead.")
    new_imports_code: str = Field(description="New imports that are required to run the new test function, and are not already imported in the test file. Give an empty string if no new imports are required. If relevant, add new imports as  'import ...' lines.")
    test_tags: str = Field(description="A single label that best describes the test, out of: ['happy path', 'edge case','other']")

class NewTests(BaseModel):
    language: str = Field(description="The programming language of the source code")
    existing_test_function_signature: str = Field(description="A single line repeating a signature header of one of the existing test functions")
    new_tests: List[SingleTest] = Field(min_items=1, max_items=4, description="A list of new test functions to append to the existing test suite, aiming to increase the code coverage. Each test should run as-is, without requiring any additional inputs or setup code. Don't introduce new dependencies")
=====


Example output:

```yaml
language: python
existing_test_function_signature: |
  ...
new_tests:
- test_behavior: |
    Test that the function returns the correct output for a single element list
  lines_to_cover: |
    [1,2,5, ...]
  test_name: |
    test_single_element_list
  test_code: |
    def ...
  new_imports_code: |
    ""
  test_tags: happy path
    ...
```


Use block scalar('|') to format each YAML output.

Response (should be a valid YAML, and nothing else):
