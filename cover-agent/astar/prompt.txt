You are a code assistant that accepts a python test file as input.
Your goal is to analyze this file, and provide several feedbacks: the programming language of the test file, the testing framework needed to run the tests in the test file, the number of tests in the test file, and the indentation of the test headers in the test file.

Here is the file that contains the existing tests, called `test_app.py`:
=========
from app import main

def test_main():
    # 0: Free cell, 1: Obstacle
    grid = [
        [0, 0, 0, 0],
        [1, 1, 0, 1],
        [0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 1, 0],
    ]
    start = (0, 0)
    goal = (3, 3)
    
    expected_path = [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)]
    actual_path = main(grid, start, goal)
    
    assert actual_path == expected_path, f"Expected {expected_path}, but got {actual_path}"

def test_no_path_found():
    # 0: Free cell, 1: Obstacle
    grid = [
        [0, 0, 0, 0],
        [1, 1, 1, 1],
        [0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 1, 0],
    ]
    start = (0, 0)
    goal = (3, 3)

    expected_path = "No path found"
    actual_path = main(grid, start, goal)

    assert actual_path == expected_path, f"Expected {expected_path}, but got {actual_path}"
=========


Now, you need to analyze the test file and provide a YAML object equivalent to type $TestsAnalysis, according to the following Pydantic definitions:
=====

class TestsAnalysis(BaseModel):
    language: str = Field(description="The programming language used by the test file")
    testing_framework: str = Field(description="The testing framework needed to run the tests in the test file")
    number_of_tests: int = Field(description="The number of tests in the test file")
    test_headers_indentation: int = Field(description="The indentation of the test headers in the test file.For example, "def test_..." has an indentation of 0, "  def test_..." has an indentation of 2, "    def test_..." has an indentation of 4, and so on.")

=====


Example output:

```yaml
language: python
testing_framework: ...
number_of_tests: ...
test_headers_indentation: ...
```

The Response should be only a valid YAML object, without any introduction text or follow-up text.

You are a code assistant that accepts a python test file as input.
Your goal is to analyze this file and provide the following: 
* The programming language of the test file
* The testing framework needed to run the tests in the test file
* The number of tests in the test file
* The line number in the test file where the new test should be inserted. 

IMPORTANT: Ensure that you account for block delimiters (e.g., curly braces in Java, `end` in Ruby) to correctly place the new test before the end of the relevant block, such as a class or method definition. If a test should live within a class then the insertion happens BEFORE the last delimiter (if relevant).

Here is the file that contains the existing tests, called `test_app.py`. Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the structure of the file. Those numbers are not a part of the original code.

user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `app.py`.
Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the code coverage report.
Those numbers are not a part of the original code.

### Test Framework
The test framework used for running tests is `pytest`.
If the current tests are part of a class and contain a 'self' input, than the generated tests should also include the `self` parameter in the test function signature.


## Code Coverage
Based on the code coverage report below, your goal is to suggest new test cases for the test file `test_app.py` against the source file `app.py` that would increase the coverage, meaning cover missing lines of code.
=========
Lines covered: [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 14, 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 39, 40, 41, 43, 44, 45, 47, 48, 50, 51, 53, 55, 56, 57, 59, 60, 61, 64, 68, 71, 73]
Lines missed: [69]
Percentage covered: 97.96%
=========


## Response
The output must be a YAML object equivalent to type $NewTests, according to the following Pydantic definitions:

    lines_to_cover: str = Field(description="A list of line numbers, currently uncovered, that this specific new test aims to cover")
    test_name: str = Field(description=" A short test name, in snake case, that reflects the behaviour to test")
    test_code: str = Field(description="A new 'pytest' test function that extends the existing test suite, and tests the behavior described in 'test_behavior'. The test should be a written like its a part of the existing test suite, if there is one, and it can use existing helper functions, setup, or teardown code. Don't iclude new imports here, use 'new_imports_code' section instead.")
    new_imports_code: str = Field(description="New imports that are required to run the new test function, and are not already imported in the test file. Give an empty string if no new imports are required. If relevant, add new imports as  'import ...' lines.")
    test_tags: str = Field(description="A single label that best describes the test, out of: ['happy path', 'edge case','other']")

class NewTests(BaseModel):
    language: str = Field(description="The programming language of the source code")
    existing_test_function_signature: str = Field(description="A single line repeating a signature header of one of the existing test functions")
    new_tests: List[SingleTest] = Field(min_items=1, max_items=4, description="A list of new test functions to append to the existing test suite, aiming to increase the code coverage. Each test should run as-is, without requiring any additional inputs or setup code. Don't introduce new dependencies")

Example output:

```yaml
language: python
existing_test_function_signature: |

    Test that the function returns the correct output for a single element list
  lines_to_cover: |

Now, you need to analyze the test file and provide a YAML object equivalent to type $TestsAnalysis, according to the following Pydantic definitions:
=====

class TestsAnalysis(BaseModel):
    language: str = Field(description="The programming language used by the test file")
    testing_framework: str = Field(description="The testing framework needed to run the tests in the test file")
    number_of_tests: int = Field(description="The number of tests in the test file")
    test_headers_indentation: int = Field(description="The indentation of the test headers in the test file.For example, "def test_..." has an indentation of 0, "  def test_..." has an indentation of 2, "    def test_..." has an indentation of 4, and so on.")

You are a code assistant that accepts a python test file as input.
Your goal is to analyze this file and provide the following: 
* The programming language of the test file
* The testing framework needed to run the tests in the test file
* The number of tests in the test file
* The line number in the test file where the new test should be inserted. 

IMPORTANT: Ensure that you account for block delimiters (e.g., curly braces in Java, `end` in Ruby) to correctly place the new test before the end of the relevant block, such as a class or method definition. If a test should live within a class then the insertion happens BEFORE the last delimiter (if relevant).

Here is the file that contains the existing tests, called `test_app.py`. Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the structure of the file. Those numbers are not a part of the original code.

You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

## Source File

### Test Framework
The test framework used for running tests is `unittest`.


## Code Coverage
Based on the code coverage report below, your goal is to suggest new test cases for the test file `test_app.py` against the source file `app.py` that would increase the coverage, meaning cover missing lines of code.
=========
Lines covered: [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 14, 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 39, 40, 41, 43, 44, 45, 47, 48, 50, 51, 53, 55, 56, 57, 59, 60, 61, 64, 68, 71, 73]
Lines missed: [69]
Percentage covered: 97.96%
=========


## Response
The output must be a YAML object equivalent to type $NewTests, according to the following Pydantic definitions:

The test should be a written like its a part of the existing test suite, if there is one, and it can use existing helper functions, setup, or teardown code. Don't iclude new imports here, use 'new_imports_code' section instead.")
    new_imports_code: str = Field(description="New imports that are required to run the new test function, and are not already imported in the test file. Give an empty string if no new imports are required. If relevant, add new imports as  'import ...' lines.")

class NewTests(BaseModel):
    language: str = Field(description="The programming language of the source code")

Your goal is to analyze this file and provide the following: 
* The programming language of the test file
* The testing framework needed to run the tests in the test file
* The number of tests in the test file
* The line number in the test file where the new test should be inserted. 

IMPORTANT: Ensure that you account for block delimiters (e.g., curly braces in Java, `end` in Ruby) to correctly place the new test before the end of the relevant block, such as a class or method definition. If a test should live within a class then the insertion happens BEFORE the last delimiter (if relevant).

user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

## Source File

You are a code assistant that accepts a python test file as input.
Your goal is to analyze this file and provide the following: 
* The programming language of the test file
* The testing framework needed to run the tests in the test file
* The number of tests in the test file
* The line number in the test file where the new test should be inserted. 

IMPORTANT: Ensure that you account for block delimiters (e.g., curly braces in Java, `end` in Ruby) to correctly place the new test before the end of the relevant block, such as a class or method definition. If a test should live within a class then the insertion happens BEFORE the last delimiter (if relevant).

Here is the file that contains the existing tests, called `test_app.py`. Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the structure of the file. Those numbers are not a part of the original code.

You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

### Test Framework
The test framework used for running tests is `unittest`.


## Code Coverage
Based on the code coverage report below, your goal is to suggest new test cases for the test file `test_app.py` against the source file `app.py` that would increase the coverage, meaning cover missing lines of code.
=========
Lines covered: [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 14, 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 39, 40, 41, 43, 44, 45, 47, 48, 50, 51, 53, 55, 56, 57, 59, 60, 61, 64, 68, 71, 73]
Lines missed: [69]
Percentage covered: 97.96%
=========

The test should be a written like its a part of the existing test suite, if there is one, and it can use existing helper functions, setup, or teardown code. Don't iclude new imports here, use 'new_imports_code' section instead.")
    new_imports_code: str = Field(description="New imports that are required to run the new test function, and are not already imported in the test file. Give an empty string if no new imports are required. If relevant, add new imports as  'import ...' lines.")

## Test File
Here is the file that contains the existing tests, called `test_app.py`:
=========
from app import main

def test_main():
    # 0: Free cell, 1: Obstacle
    grid = [
        [0, 0, 0, 0],
        [1, 1, 0, 1],
        [0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 1, 0],
    ]
    start = (0, 0)
    goal = (3, 3)
    
    expected_path = [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)]
    actual_path = main(grid, start, goal)
    
    assert actual_path == expected_path, f"Expected {expected_path}, but got {actual_path}"

def test_no_path_found():
    # 0: Free cell, 1: Obstacle
    grid = [
        [0, 0, 0, 0],
        [1, 1, 1, 1],
        [0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 1, 0],
    ]
    start = (0, 0)
    goal = (3, 3)

    expected_path = "No path found"
    actual_path = main(grid, start, goal)

    assert actual_path == expected_path, f"Expected {expected_path}, but got {actual_path}"

### Test Framework
The test framework used for running tests is `unittest`.


## Code Coverage
Based on the code coverage report below, your goal is to suggest new test cases for the test file `test_app.py` against the source file `app.py` that would increase the coverage, meaning cover missing lines of code.
=========
Lines covered: [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 14, 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 39, 40, 41, 43, 44, 45, 47, 48, 50, 51, 53, 55, 56, 57, 59, 60, 61, 64, 68, 71, 73]
Lines missed: [69]
Percentage covered: 97.96%
=========


## Response
The output must be a YAML object equivalent to type $NewTests, according to the following Pydantic definitions:
=====
class SingleTest(BaseModel):
    test_behavior: str = Field(description="Short description of the behavior the test covers")
    lines_to_cover: str = Field(description="A list of line numbers, currently uncovered, that this specific new test aims to cover")
    test_name: str = Field(description=" A short test name, in snake case, that reflects the behaviour to test")
    test_code: str = Field(description="A new 'unittest' test function that extends the existing test suite, and tests the behavior described in 'test_behavior'. The test should be a written like its a part of the existing test suite, if there is one, and it can use existing helper functions, setup, or teardown code. Don't iclude new imports here, use 'new_imports_code' section instead.")
    new_imports_code: str = Field(description="New imports that are required to run the new test function, and are not already imported in the test file. Give an empty string if no new imports are required. If relevant, add new imports as  'import ...' lines.")
    test_tags: str = Field(description="A single label that best describes the test, out of: ['happy path', 'edge case','other']")

class NewTests(BaseModel):
    language: str = Field(description="The programming language of the source code")
    existing_test_function_signature: str = Field(description="A single line repeating a signature header of one of the existing test functions")
    new_tests: List[SingleTest] = Field(min_items=1, max_items=4, description="A list of new test functions to append to the existing test suite, aiming to increase the code coverage. Each test should run as-is, without requiring any additional inputs or setup code. Don't introduce new dependencies")
=====


Example output:

```yaml
language: python
existing_test_function_signature: |
  ...
new_tests:
- test_behavior: |
    Test that the function returns the correct output for a single element list
  lines_to_cover: |
    [1,2,5, ...]
  test_name: |
    test_single_element_list
  test_code: |
    def ...
  new_imports_code: |
    ""
  test_tags: happy path
    ...
```


Use block scalar('|') to format each YAML output.

Response (should be a valid YAML, and nothing else):
```yaml
