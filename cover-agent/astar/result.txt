Explanation:
The test file is written in Python and uses the pytest testing framework. There are two tests in the file, which are defined on lines 3 and 20. The relevant line number to insert new tests after is line 19, as this is where the last test in the suite ends. The relevant line number to insert new imports after is line 1, as this is where the existing imports end.
