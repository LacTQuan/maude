user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `app.py`.
Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the code coverage report.
Those numbers are not a part of the original code.

### Test Framework
The test framework used for running tests is `pytest`.
If the current tests are part of a class and contain a 'self' input, than the generated tests should also include the `self` parameter in the test function signature.


## Previous Iterations Failed Tests
Below is a list of failed tests that were generated in previous iterations. Do not generate the same tests again, and take the failed tests into account when generating new tests.

## Code Coverage
Based on the code coverage report below, your goal is to suggest new test cases for the test file `test_app.py` against the source file `app.py` that would increase the coverage, meaning cover missing lines of code.
=========
Lines covered: [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 14, 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 39, 40, 41, 43, 44, 45, 47, 48, 50, 51, 53, 55, 56, 57, 59, 60, 61, 64, 68, 71, 73]
Lines missed: [69]
Percentage covered: 97.96%
=========


## Response
The output must be a YAML object equivalent to type $NewTests, according to the following Pydantic definitions:
=====

The test should be a written like its a part of the existing test suite, if there is one, and it can use existing helper functions, setup, or teardown code. Don't iclude new imports here, use 'new_imports_code' section instead.")
    new_imports_code: str = Field(description="New imports that are required to run the new test function, and are not already imported in the test file. Give an empty string if no new imports are required. If relevant, add new imports as  'import ...' lines.")
    test_tags: str = Field(description="A single label that best describes the test, out of: ['happy path', 'edge case','other']")

class NewTests(BaseModel):
    language: str = Field(description="The programming language of the source code")

You are a code assistant that accepts a python test file as input.
Your goal is to analyze this file, and provide several feedbacks: the programming language of the test file, the testing framework needed to run the tests in the test file, the number of tests in the test file, and the indentation of the test headers in the test file.

Here is the file that contains the existing tests, called `test_app.py`:

You are a code assistant that accepts a python test file as input.
Your goal is to analyze this file and provide the following: 
* The programming language of the test file
* The testing framework needed to run the tests in the test file
* The number of tests in the test file
* The line number in the test file where the new test should be inserted. 

IMPORTANT: Ensure that you account for block delimiters (e.g., curly braces in Java, `end` in Ruby) to correctly place the new test before the end of the relevant block, such as a class or method definition. If a test should live within a class then the insertion happens BEFORE the last delimiter (if relevant).

Here is the file that contains the existing tests, called `test_app.py`. Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the structure of the file. Those numbers are not a part of the original code.

user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `app.py`.
Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the code coverage report.

user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `app.py`.
Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the code coverage report.
Those numbers are not a part of the original code.

user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `app.py`.
Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the code coverage report.
Those numbers are not a part of the original code.

You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `app.py`.
Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the code coverage report.
Those numbers are not a part of the original code.

## Code Coverage
Based on the code coverage report below, your goal is to suggest new test cases for the test file `test_app.py` against the source file `app.py` that would increase the coverage, meaning cover missing lines of code.
=========
Lines covered: [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 14, 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 39, 40, 41, 43, 44, 45, 47, 48, 50, 51, 53, 55, 56, 57, 59, 60, 61, 64, 68, 71, 73]
Lines missed: [69]
Percentage covered: 97.96%
=========


## Response
The output must be a YAML object equivalent to type $NewTests, according to the following Pydantic definitions:
=====
class SingleTest(BaseModel):
    test_behavior: str = Field(description="Short description of the behavior the test covers")
    lines_to_cover: str = Field(description="A list of line numbers, currently uncovered, that this specific new test aims to cover")
    test_name: str = Field(description=" A short test name, in snake case, that reflects the behaviour to test")
    test_code: str = Field(description="A new 'unittest' test function that extends the existing test suite, and tests the behavior described in 'test_behavior'. The test should be a written like its a part of the existing test suite, if there is one, and it can use existing helper functions, setup, or teardown code. Don't iclude new imports here, use 'new_imports_code' section instead.")
    new_imports_code: str = Field(description="New imports that are required to run the new test function, and are not already imported in the test file. Give an empty string if no new imports are required. If relevant, add new imports as  'import ...' lines.")
    test_tags: str = Field(description="A single label that best describes the test, out of: ['happy path', 'edge case','other']")

class NewTests(BaseModel):
    language: str = Field(description="The programming language of the source code")
    existing_test_function_signature: str = Field(description="A single line repeating a signature header of one of the existing test functions")
    new_tests: List[SingleTest] = Field(min_items=1, max_items=4, description="A list of new test functions to append to the existing test suite, aiming to increase the code coverage. Each test should run as-is, without requiring any additional inputs or setup code. Don't introduce new dependencies")
=====


Example output:

```yaml
language: python
existing_test_function_signature: |
  ...
new_tests:
- test_behavior: |
    Test that the function returns the correct output for a single element list
  lines_to_cover: |
    [1,2,5, ...]
  test_name: |
    test_single_element_list
  test_code: |
    def ...
  new_imports_code: |
    ""
  test_tags: happy path

Short and concise analysis of why the test run failed, and and recommended Fixes (dont add any other information):

system: 
user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `app.py`.
Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the code coverage report.
Those numbers are not a part of the original code.

Test execution error analysis:
**Test Failure Summary:**

The test `test_no_obstacles` failed because the actual path found by the `main` function was different from the expected path. Specifically, the actual path was [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], while the expected path was [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)].

**Recommended Fixes:**

1. Check if the `get_successors` function is correctly generating the successors for the current node.
2. Check if the `heuristic` function is correctly calculating the heuristic cost for each successor.
3. Check if the `reconstruct_path` function is correctly reconstructing the path from the goal node to the start node.

```
Test execution error analysis:
**Test Failure Analysis:**

The test `test_with_obstacles` failed due to a mismatch between the expected and actual paths found by the `main` function. The expected path was `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)]`, while the actual path was `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)]`. The difference lies in the movement from (1, 2) to (2, 3) in the expected path, which is replaced by a movement from (1, 2) to (3, 2) in the actual path.

**Recommended Fixes:**

1. **Review the `get_successors` function:** Ensure that it correctly generates successors for a given node and grid, considering both obstacles and boundary conditions.
2. **Check the heuristic function:** Verify that the heuristic function provides a reasonable estimate of the distance to the goal, guiding the search algorithm effectively.
3. **Examine the `reconstruct_path` function:** Confirm that it correctly traces the path back from the goal node to the start node, considering the parent pointers of each node.

Short and concise analysis of why the test run failed, and and recommended Fixes (dont add any other information):

system: 
user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `app.py`.
Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the code coverage report.

Test execution error analysis:
**Test Failure Summary:**

The test `test_no_obstacles` failed because the actual path found by the `main` function was different from the expected path. Specifically, the actual path was [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], while the expected path was [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)].

**Recommended Fixes:**

1. Check if the `get_successors` function is correctly generating the successors for the current node.
2. Check if the `heuristic` function is correctly calculating the heuristic cost for each successor.
3. Check if the `reconstruct_path` function is correctly reconstructing the path from the goal node to the start node.

```
Test execution error analysis:
**Test Failure Analysis:**

The test `test_with_obstacles` failed due to a mismatch between the expected and actual paths found by the `main` function. The expected path was `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)]`, while the actual path was `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)]`. The difference lies in the movement from (1, 2) to (2, 3) in the expected path, which is replaced by a movement from (1, 2) to (3, 2) in the actual path.

**Recommended Fixes:**

1. **Review the `get_successors` function:** Ensure that it correctly generates successors for a given node and grid, considering both obstacles and boundary conditions.
2. **Check the heuristic function:** Verify that the heuristic function provides a reasonable estimate of the distance to the goal, guiding the search algorithm effectively.
3. **Examine the `reconstruct_path` function:** Confirm that it correctly traces the path back from the goal node to the start node, considering the parent pointers of each node.

Test execution error analysis:
**Failing test:** `test_no_obstacles`

**Reason for failure:**
The test expects the path to be `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)]`, but the actual path returned by the function is `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]`. The difference is in the initial movement: instead of moving down (0, 1), the function moves right (1, 0).

**Recommended fix:**
Check the logic in the `get_successors` function to ensure that it correctly identifies the available directions for movement. It's possible that there is an issue with the boundary checks or the handling of obstacles.

You are a code assistant that accepts a python test file as input.
Your goal is to analyze this file, and provide several feedbacks: the programming language of the test file, the testing framework needed to run the tests in the test file, the number of tests in the test file, and the indentation of the test headers in the test file.

You are a code assistant that accepts a python test file as input.
Your goal is to analyze this file and provide the following: 
* The programming language of the test file
* The testing framework needed to run the tests in the test file
* The number of tests in the test file
* The line number in the test file where the new test should be inserted. 

IMPORTANT: Ensure that you account for block delimiters (e.g., curly braces in Java, `end` in Ruby) to correctly place the new test before the end of the relevant block, such as a class or method definition. If a test should live within a class then the insertion happens BEFORE the last delimiter (if relevant).

Here is the file that contains the existing tests, called `test_app.py`. Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the structure of the file. Those numbers are not a part of the original code.

You are a code assistant that accepts a python test file as input.
Your goal is to analyze this file and provide the following: 
* The programming language of the test file
* The testing framework needed to run the tests in the test file
* The number of tests in the test file
* The line number in the test file where the new test should be inserted. 

IMPORTANT: Ensure that you account for block delimiters (e.g., curly braces in Java, `end` in Ruby) to correctly place the new test before the end of the relevant block, such as a class or method definition. If a test should live within a class then the insertion happens BEFORE the last delimiter (if relevant).

Here is the file that contains the existing tests, called `test_app.py`. Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the structure of the file. Those numbers are not a part of the original code.

Now, you need to analyze the test file and provide a YAML object equivalent to type $TestsAnalysis, according to the following Pydantic definitions:
=====
class TestsAnalysis(BaseModel):
    language: str = Field(description="The programming language used by the test file")
    testing_framework: str = Field(description="The testing framework needed to run the tests in the test file")

    relevant_line_number_to_insert_tests_after: int = Field(description="The line number in the test file, **after which** the new tests should be inserted, so they will be a part of the existing test suite. Place the new tests after the last test in the suite.")
    relevant_line_number_to_insert_imports_after: int = Field(description="The line number in the test file, **after which**  new imports should be inserted, so they will be a legal valid code, and the new test file will be able to run. The new imports should be introduced as independent import lines, and not as part of the existing imports.")

user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `app.py`.

        [0, 0, 0, 0],

### Test Framework
The test framework used for running tests is `pytest`.
If the current tests are part of a class and contain a 'self' input, than the generated tests should also include the `self` parameter in the test function signature.


## Code Coverage
Based on the code coverage report below, your goal is to suggest new test cases for the test file `test_app.py` against the source file `app.py` that would increase the coverage, meaning cover missing lines of code.
=========
Lines covered: [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 14, 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 39, 40, 41, 43, 44, 45, 47, 48, 50, 51, 53, 55, 56, 57, 59, 60, 61, 64, 68, 71, 73]
Lines missed: [69]
Percentage covered: 97.96%
=========


## Response
The output must be a YAML object equivalent to type $NewTests, according to the following Pydantic definitions:
=====
class SingleTest(BaseModel):
    test_behavior: str = Field(description="Short description of the behavior the test covers")
    lines_to_cover: str = Field(description="A list of line numbers, currently uncovered, that this specific new test aims to cover")
    test_name: str = Field(description=" A short test name, in snake case, that reflects the behaviour to test")
    test_code: str = Field(description="A new 'pytest' test function that extends the existing test suite, and tests the behavior described in 'test_behavior'. The test should be a written like its a part of the existing test suite, if there is one, and it can use existing helper functions, setup, or teardown code. Don't iclude new imports here, use 'new_imports_code' section instead.")
    new_imports_code: str = Field(description="New imports that are required to run the new test function, and are not already imported in the test file. Give an empty string if no new imports are required. If relevant, add new imports as  'import ...' lines.")
    test_tags: str = Field(description="A single label that best describes the test, out of: ['happy path', 'edge case','other']")

class NewTests(BaseModel):
    language: str = Field(description="The programming language of the source code")
    existing_test_function_signature: str = Field(description="A single line repeating a signature header of one of the existing test functions")
    new_tests: List[SingleTest] = Field(min_items=1, max_items=4, description="A list of new test functions to append to the existing test suite, aiming to increase the code coverage. Each test should run as-is, without requiring any additional inputs or setup code. Don't introduce new dependencies")
=====


Example output:

```yaml
language: python
existing_test_function_signature: |
  ...
new_tests:
- test_behavior: |
    Test that the function returns the correct output for a single element list
  lines_to_cover: |

Short and concise analysis of why the test run failed, and and recommended Fixes (dont add any other information):

system: 
user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `app.py`.
Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the code coverage report.

```
Test execution error analysis:
**Test Failure Summary:**

The test `test_multiple_paths_to_goal` failed due to an assertion error. The expected path was `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)]`, but the actual path was `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]`.

**Recommended Fixes:**

1. Check the implementation of the `get_successors` function to ensure that it correctly identifies all valid successors for a given node.
2. Review the heuristic function to verify that it accurately estimates the distance to the goal.
3. Consider adding additional test cases to cover scenarios where multiple paths to the goal exist.

Short and concise analysis of why the test run failed, and and recommended Fixes (dont add any other information):

system: 
user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

## Source File

### Test Framework
The test framework used for running tests is `unittest`.


## Previous Iterations Failed Tests
Below is a list of failed tests that were generated in previous iterations. Do not generate the same tests again, and take the failed tests into account when generating new tests.

```
Test execution error analysis:
**Test Failure Summary:**

The test `test_multiple_paths_to_goal` failed due to an assertion error. The expected path was `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)]`, but the actual path was `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]`.

**Recommended Fixes:**

1. Check the implementation of the `get_successors` function to ensure that it correctly identifies all valid successors for a given node.
2. Review the heuristic function to verify that it accurately estimates the distance to the goal.
3. Consider adding additional test cases to cover scenarios where multiple paths to the goal exist.

```
Test execution error analysis:
**Test Failure Summary:**

The test `test_multiple_paths_to_goal` failed because the actual path found by the algorithm differed from the expected path.

**Recommended Fixes:**

1. Check if the heuristic function is correctly implemented.
2. Verify that the algorithm is correctly handling multiple paths to the goal.
3. Ensure that the grid is correctly initialized and that the start and goal positions are valid.

### Test Framework
The test framework used for running tests is `unittest`.


## Previous Iterations Failed Tests
Below is a list of failed tests that were generated in previous iterations. Do not generate the same tests again, and take the failed tests into account when generating new tests.
======
Failed Test:
```
{"test_behavior": "Test that the function returns the correct output when there are multiple paths to the goal\n", "lines_to_cover": "[69]\n", "test_name": "test_multiple_paths_to_goal\n", "test_code": "def test_multiple_paths_to_goal():\n    # 0: Free cell, 1: Obstacle\n    grid = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0],\n    ]\n    start = (0, 0)\n    goal = (3, 3)\n\n    expected_path = [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)]\n    actual_path = main(grid, start, goal)\n\n    assert actual_path == expected_path, f\"Expected {expected_path}, but got {actual_path}\"\n", "new_imports_code": "\"\"\n", "test_tags": "happy path"}
```
Test execution error analysis:
**Test Failure Summary:**

The test `test_multiple_paths_to_goal` failed due to an assertion error. The expected path was `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)]`, but the actual path was `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]`.

**Recommended Fixes:**

1. Check the implementation of the `get_successors` function to ensure that it correctly identifies all valid successors for a given node.
2. Review the heuristic function to verify that it accurately estimates the distance to the goal.
3. Consider adding additional test cases to cover scenarios where multiple paths to the goal exist.


Failed Test:
```
{"test_behavior": "Test that the function returns the correct output when there are multiple paths to the goal\n", "lines_to_cover": "[69]\n", "test_name": "test_multiple_paths_to_goal\n", "test_code": "def test_multiple_paths_to_goal():\n    # 0: Free cell, 1: Obstacle\n    grid = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0],\n    ]\n    start = (0, 0)\n    goal = (3, 3)\n\n    expected_path = [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)]\n    actual_path = main(grid, start, goal)\n\n    assert actual_path == expected_path, f\"Expected {expected_path}, but got {actual_path}\"\n", "new_imports_code": "\"\"\n", "test_tags": "happy path"}
```
Test execution error analysis:
**Test Failure Summary:**

The test `test_multiple_paths_to_goal` failed because the actual path found by the algorithm differed from the expected path.

**Recommended Fixes:**

1. Check if the heuristic function is correctly implemented.
2. Verify that the algorithm is correctly handling multiple paths to the goal.
3. Ensure that the grid is correctly initialized and that the start and goal positions are valid.

## Code Coverage
Based on the code coverage report below, your goal is to suggest new test cases for the test file `test_app.py` against the source file `app.py` that would increase the coverage, meaning cover missing lines of code.
=========
Lines covered: [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 14, 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 39, 40, 41, 43, 44, 45, 47, 48, 50, 51, 53, 55, 56, 57, 59, 60, 61, 64, 68, 71, 73]
Lines missed: [69]
Percentage covered: 97.96%
=========


## Response
The output must be a YAML object equivalent to type $NewTests, according to the following Pydantic definitions:

The test should be a written like its a part of the existing test suite, if there is one, and it can use existing helper functions, setup, or teardown code. Don't iclude new imports here, use 'new_imports_code' section instead.")
    new_imports_code: str = Field(description="New imports that are required to run the new test function, and are not already imported in the test file. Give an empty string if no new imports are required. If relevant, add new imports as  'import ...' lines.")
    test_tags: str = Field(description="A single label that best describes the test, out of: ['happy path', 'edge case','other']")

class NewTests(BaseModel):
    language: str = Field(description="The programming language of the source code")

system: 
user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `app.py`.
Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the code coverage report.

```
Test execution error analysis:
**Test Failure Summary:**

The test `test_multiple_paths_to_goal` failed due to an assertion error. The expected path was `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)]`, but the actual path was `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]`.

**Recommended Fixes:**

1. Check the implementation of the `get_successors` function to ensure that it correctly identifies all valid successors for a given node.
2. Review the heuristic function to verify that it accurately estimates the distance to the goal.
3. Consider adding additional test cases to cover scenarios where multiple paths to the goal exist.

Test execution error analysis:
**Test Failure Summary:**

The test `test_multiple_paths_to_goal` failed because the actual path found by the algorithm differed from the expected path.

**Recommended Fixes:**

1. Check if the heuristic function is correctly implemented.
2. Verify that the algorithm is correctly handling multiple paths to the goal.
3. Ensure that the grid is correctly initialized and that the start and goal positions are valid.

**Reason for Failure:**
The test expected a `ValueError` to be raised when an invalid goal position is provided, but the test failed because the exception was not raised.

**Recommended Fix:**
Check if the function `main` raises a `ValueError` when an invalid goal position is provided. If it does not, update the function to raise the appropriate exception.

Test execution error analysis:
**Test Failure Summary:**

The test `test_multiple_paths_to_goal` failed due to an assertion error. The expected path was `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)]`, but the actual path was `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]`.

**Recommended Fixes:**

1. Check the implementation of the `get_successors` function to ensure that it correctly identifies all valid successors for a given node.
2. Review the heuristic function to verify that it accurately estimates the distance to the goal.
3. Consider adding additional test cases to cover scenarios where multiple paths to the goal exist.

**Test Failure Summary:**

The test `test_multiple_paths_to_goal` failed because the actual path found by the algorithm differed from the expected path.

**Recommended Fixes:**

1. Check if the heuristic function is correctly implemented.
2. Verify that the algorithm is correctly handling multiple paths to the goal.
3. Ensure that the grid is correctly initialized and that the start and goal positions are valid.

Short and concise analysis of why the test run failed, and and recommended Fixes (dont add any other information):

system: 
user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `app.py`.
Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the code coverage report.
Those numbers are not a part of the original code.

Test execution error analysis:
**Test Failure Summary:**

The test `test_multiple_paths_to_goal` failed due to an assertion error. The expected path was `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)]`, but the actual path was `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]`.

**Recommended Fixes:**

1. Check the implementation of the `get_successors` function to ensure that it correctly identifies all valid successors for a given node.
2. Review the heuristic function to verify that it accurately estimates the distance to the goal.
3. Consider adding additional test cases to cover scenarios where multiple paths to the goal exist.

Test execution error analysis:
**Test Failure Summary:**

The test `test_multiple_paths_to_goal` failed because the actual path found by the algorithm differed from the expected path.

**Recommended Fixes:**

1. Check if the heuristic function is correctly implemented.
2. Verify that the algorithm is correctly handling multiple paths to the goal.
3. Ensure that the grid is correctly initialized and that the start and goal positions are valid.

**Test Failure Summary:**

The test `test_invalid_start_position` failed because it expected a `ValueError` to be raised when an invalid start position is provided, but the exception was not raised.

**Recommended Fixes:**

**Reason for Failure:**
The test expected a `ValueError` to be raised when an invalid goal position is provided, but the test failed because the exception was not raised.

Test execution error analysis:
**Test Failure Summary:**

The test `test_invalid_start_position` failed because the expected `ValueError` exception was not raised when an invalid start position was provided.

**Recommended Fixes:**

1. In the `main` function, add a check to validate the start position before proceeding with the A* algorithm. Raise a `ValueError` if the start position is invalid.
2. Update the test case to assert that a `ValueError` is raised when an invalid start position is provided.

* **Fix:** The test expects a `ValueError` to be raised when an invalid goal position is provided to the `main` function. However, the code does not raise this exception. Update the code to raise a `ValueError` when an invalid goal position is encountered.

user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `app.py`.
Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the code coverage report.
Those numbers are not a part of the original code.

Test execution error analysis:
**Test Failure Summary:**

The test `test_multiple_paths_to_goal` failed due to an assertion error. The expected path was `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)]`, but the actual path was `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]`.

**Recommended Fixes:**

1. Check the implementation of the `get_successors` function to ensure that it correctly identifies all valid successors for a given node.
2. Review the heuristic function to verify that it accurately estimates the distance to the goal.
3. Consider adding additional test cases to cover scenarios where multiple paths to the goal exist.

Test execution error analysis:
**Failure 1:**

* **Test:** `test_invalid_goal_position`
* **Error:** `Failed: DID NOT RAISE <class 'ValueError'>`
* **Fix:** The test expects a `ValueError` to be raised when an invalid goal position is provided to the `main` function. However, the code does not raise this exception. Update the code to raise a `ValueError` when an invalid goal position is encountered.

## Code Coverage
Based on the code coverage report below, your goal is to suggest new test cases for the test file `test_app.py` against the source file `app.py` that would increase the coverage, meaning cover missing lines of code.
=========
Lines covered: [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 14, 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 39, 40, 41, 43, 44, 45, 47, 48, 50, 51, 53, 55, 56, 57, 59, 60, 61, 64, 68, 71, 73]
Lines missed: [69]
Percentage covered: 97.96%
=========


## Response
The output must be a YAML object equivalent to type $NewTests, according to the following Pydantic definitions:
=====
class SingleTest(BaseModel):
    test_behavior: str = Field(description="Short description of the behavior the test covers")
    lines_to_cover: str = Field(description="A list of line numbers, currently uncovered, that this specific new test aims to cover")
    test_name: str = Field(description=" A short test name, in snake case, that reflects the behaviour to test")
    test_code: str = Field(description="A new 'unittest' test function that extends the existing test suite, and tests the behavior described in 'test_behavior'. The test should be a written like its a part of the existing test suite, if there is one, and it can use existing helper functions, setup, or teardown code. Don't iclude new imports here, use 'new_imports_code' section instead.")
    new_imports_code: str = Field(description="New imports that are required to run the new test function, and are not already imported in the test file. Give an empty string if no new imports are required. If relevant, add new imports as  'import ...' lines.")
    test_tags: str = Field(description="A single label that best describes the test, out of: ['happy path', 'edge case','other']")

class NewTests(BaseModel):
    language: str = Field(description="The programming language of the source code")
    existing_test_function_signature: str = Field(description="A single line repeating a signature header of one of the existing test functions")
    new_tests: List[SingleTest] = Field(min_items=1, max_items=4, description="A list of new test functions to append to the existing test suite, aiming to increase the code coverage. Each test should run as-is, without requiring any additional inputs or setup code. Don't introduce new dependencies")
=====


Example output:

```yaml
language: python
existing_test_function_signature: |
  ...
new_tests:
- test_behavior: |
    Test that the function returns the correct output for a single element list
  lines_to_cover: |

Short and concise analysis of why the test run failed, and and recommended Fixes (dont add any other information):

system: 
user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `app.py`.
Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the code coverage report.
Those numbers are not a part of the original code.

```
Test execution error analysis:
**Test Failure Summary:**

The test `test_multiple_paths_to_goal` failed due to an assertion error. The expected path was `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)]`, but the actual path was `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]`.

**Recommended Fixes:**

1. Check the implementation of the `get_successors` function to ensure that it correctly identifies all valid successors for a given node.
2. Review the heuristic function to verify that it accurately estimates the distance to the goal.
3. Consider adding additional test cases to cover scenarios where multiple paths to the goal exist.

Test execution error analysis:
**Test Failure Summary:**

The test `test_multiple_paths_to_goal` failed because the actual path found by the algorithm differed from the expected path.

**Recommended Fixes:**

1. Check if the heuristic function is correctly implemented.
2. Verify that the algorithm is correctly handling multiple paths to the goal.
3. Ensure that the grid is correctly initialized and that the start and goal positions are valid.

Test execution error analysis:
**Failing Test:** `test_invalid_goal_position`

**Reason for Failure:**
The test expected a `ValueError` to be raised when an invalid goal position is provided, but the test failed because the exception was not raised.

**Recommended Fix:**
Check if the function `main` raises a `ValueError` when an invalid goal position is provided. If it does not, update the function to raise the appropriate exception.

**Test Failure Summary:**

The test `test_invalid_start_position` failed because the expected `ValueError` exception was not raised when an invalid start position was provided.

**Recommended Fixes:**

1. In the `main` function, add a check to validate the start position before proceeding with the A* algorithm. Raise a `ValueError` if the start position is invalid.
2. Update the test case to assert that a `ValueError` is raised when an invalid start position is provided.

**Test Failure Summary:**

The test `test_multiple_paths_to_goal` failed due to an assertion error. The expected path was `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)]`, but the actual path was `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]`.

**Recommended Fixes:**

1. Check the implementation of the `get_successors` function to ensure that it correctly generates successors for a given node.
2. Review the heuristic function to ensure that it provides a valid estimate of the distance to the goal.
3. Consider adding additional test cases to cover different scenarios where multiple paths to the goal exist.

Short and concise analysis of why the test run failed, and and recommended Fixes (dont add any other information):

system: 
user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `app.py`.
Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the code coverage report.
Those numbers are not a part of the original code.

Test execution error analysis:
**Test Failure Summary:**

The test `test_multiple_paths_to_goal` failed due to an assertion error. The expected path was `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)]`, but the actual path was `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]`.

**Recommended Fixes:**

1. Check the implementation of the `get_successors` function to ensure that it correctly identifies all valid successors for a given node.
2. Review the heuristic function to verify that it accurately estimates the distance to the goal.
3. Consider adding additional test cases to cover scenarios where multiple paths to the goal exist.

```
Test execution error analysis:
**Failing Test:** `test_empty_grid`

**Reason for Failure:**
The test expects the `main` function to return "No path found" when given an empty grid, but instead, it returns a list containing the starting position `[(0, 0)]`.

**Recommended Fix:**
In the `main` function, when the grid is empty, return "No path found" instead of attempting to find a path.

Test execution error analysis:
**Failure 1/1:**

**Test:** `test_multiple_paths_to_goal`

**Failure Reason:** The actual path found by the algorithm differs from the expected path.

**Recommended Fix:**
- Check if the heuristic function is correctly implemented.
- Verify if the algorithm is correctly handling multiple paths to the goal.
- Ensure that the grid is correctly initialized and that the start and goal positions are valid.

```
Test execution error analysis:
**Failure Summary:**

The test `test_empty_grid` failed because the expected path was "No path found", but the actual path returned by the `main` function was `[(0, 0)]`.

**Recommended Fixes:**

1. Check if the `main` function correctly handles empty grids and returns "No path found" in such cases.
2. Review the implementation of the `get_successors` function to ensure it doesn't generate successors for cells outside the grid boundaries.

You are a code assistant that accepts a python test file as input.
Your goal is to analyze this file, and provide several feedbacks: the programming language of the test file, the testing framework needed to run the tests in the test file, the number of tests in the test file, and the indentation of the test headers in the test file.

Here is the file that contains the existing tests, called `test_app.py`:

Now, you need to analyze the test file and provide a YAML object equivalent to type $TestsAnalysis, according to the following Pydantic definitions:
=====

class TestsAnalysis(BaseModel):
    language: str = Field(description="The programming language used by the test file")
    testing_framework: str = Field(description="The testing framework needed to run the tests in the test file")
    number_of_tests: int = Field(description="The number of tests in the test file")
    test_headers_indentation: int = Field(description="The indentation of the test headers in the test file.For example, "def test_..." has an indentation of 0, "  def test_..." has an indentation of 2, "    def test_..." has an indentation of 4, and so on.")

=====


Example output:

```yaml

You are a code assistant that accepts a python test file as input.
Your goal is to analyze this file and provide the following: 
* The programming language of the test file
* The testing framework needed to run the tests in the test file
* The number of tests in the test file
* The line number in the test file where the new test should be inserted. 

IMPORTANT: Ensure that you account for block delimiters (e.g., curly braces in Java, `end` in Ruby) to correctly place the new test before the end of the relevant block, such as a class or method definition. If a test should live within a class then the insertion happens BEFORE the last delimiter (if relevant).

Here is the file that contains the existing tests, called `test_app.py`. Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the structure of the file. Those numbers are not a part of the original code.

user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.

user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

Answer:
```yaml

system: 
user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python test file as input.
Your goal is to analyze this file and provide the following: 
* The programming language of the test file
* The testing framework needed to run the tests in the test file
* The number of tests in the test file
* The line number in the test file where the new test should be inserted. 

IMPORTANT: Ensure that you account for block delimiters (e.g., curly braces in Java, `end` in Ruby) to correctly place the new test before the end of the relevant block, such as a class or method definition. If a test should live within a class then the insertion happens BEFORE the last delimiter (if relevant).

=====
class TestsAnalysis(BaseModel):
    language: str = Field(description="The programming language used by the test file")
    testing_framework: str = Field(description="The testing framework needed to run the tests in the test file")

user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `app.py`.
Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the code coverage report.
Those numbers are not a part of the original code.

### Test Framework
The test framework used for running tests is `pytest`.
If the current tests are part of a class and contain a 'self' input, than the generated tests should also include the `self` parameter in the test function signature.


## Code Coverage
Based on the code coverage report below, your goal is to suggest new test cases for the test file `test_app.py` against the source file `app.py` that would increase the coverage, meaning cover missing lines of code.
=========
Lines covered: [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 14, 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 39, 40, 41, 43, 44, 45, 47, 48, 50, 51, 53, 55, 56, 57, 59, 60, 61, 64, 68, 71, 73]
Lines missed: [69]
Percentage covered: 97.96%

    test_code: str = Field(description="A new 'pytest' test function that extends the existing test suite, and tests the behavior described in 'test_behavior'. The test should be a written like its a part of the existing test suite, if there is one, and it can use existing helper functions, setup, or teardown code. Don't iclude new imports here, use 'new_imports_code' section instead.")
    new_imports_code: str = Field(description="New imports that are required to run the new test function, and are not already imported in the test file. Give an empty string if no new imports are required. If relevant, add new imports as  'import ...' lines.")
    test_tags: str = Field(description="A single label that best describes the test, out of: ['happy path', 'edge case','other']")

class NewTests(BaseModel):
    language: str = Field(description="The programming language of the source code")

* The programming language of the test file
* The testing framework needed to run the tests in the test file
* The number of tests in the test file
* The line number in the test file where the new test should be inserted. 

IMPORTANT: Ensure that you account for block delimiters (e.g., curly braces in Java, `end` in Ruby) to correctly place the new test before the end of the relevant block, such as a class or method definition. If a test should live within a class then the insertion happens BEFORE the last delimiter (if relevant).

## Response
The output must be a YAML object equivalent to type $NewTests, according to the following Pydantic definitions:
=====
class SingleTest(BaseModel):
    test_behavior: str = Field(description="Short description of the behavior the test covers")
    lines_to_cover: str = Field(description="A list of line numbers, currently uncovered, that this specific new test aims to cover")
    test_name: str = Field(description=" A short test name, in snake case, that reflects the behaviour to test")
    test_code: str = Field(description="A new 'unittest' test function that extends the existing test suite, and tests the behavior described in 'test_behavior'. The test should be a written like its a part of the existing test suite, if there is one, and it can use existing helper functions, setup, or teardown code. Don't iclude new imports here, use 'new_imports_code' section instead.")
    new_imports_code: str = Field(description="New imports that are required to run the new test function, and are not already imported in the test file. Give an empty string if no new imports are required. If relevant, add new imports as  'import ...' lines.")
    test_tags: str = Field(description="A single label that best describes the test, out of: ['happy path', 'edge case','other']")

class NewTests(BaseModel):
    language: str = Field(description="The programming language of the source code")
    existing_test_function_signature: str = Field(description="A single line repeating a signature header of one of the existing test functions")
    new_tests: List[SingleTest] = Field(min_items=1, max_items=4, description="A list of new test functions to append to the existing test suite, aiming to increase the code coverage. Each test should run as-is, without requiring any additional inputs or setup code. Don't introduce new dependencies")
=====


Example output:

```yaml
language: python
existing_test_function_signature: |
  ...
new_tests:
- test_behavior: |
    Test that the function returns the correct output for a single element list
  lines_to_cover: |

You are a code assistant that accepts a python test file as input.
Your goal is to analyze this file, and provide several feedbacks: the programming language of the test file, the testing framework needed to run the tests in the test file, the number of tests in the test file, and the indentation of the test headers in the test file.

Here is the file that contains the existing tests, called `test_app.py`:

Now, you need to analyze the test file and provide a YAML object equivalent to type $TestsAnalysis, according to the following Pydantic definitions:
=====

class TestsAnalysis(BaseModel):
    language: str = Field(description="The programming language used by the test file")
    testing_framework: str = Field(description="The testing framework needed to run the tests in the test file")
    number_of_tests: int = Field(description="The number of tests in the test file")
    test_headers_indentation: int = Field(description="The indentation of the test headers in the test file.For example, "def test_..." has an indentation of 0, "  def test_..." has an indentation of 2, "    def test_..." has an indentation of 4, and so on.")

=====


Example output:

```yaml
language: python
testing_framework: ...
number_of_tests: ...
test_headers_indentation: ...
```

The Response should be only a valid YAML object, without any introduction text or follow-up text.

Answer:
```yaml

system: 
user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python test file as input.
Your goal is to analyze this file and provide the following: 
* The programming language of the test file
* The testing framework needed to run the tests in the test file
* The number of tests in the test file
* The line number in the test file where the new test should be inserted. 

IMPORTANT: Ensure that you account for block delimiters (e.g., curly braces in Java, `end` in Ruby) to correctly place the new test before the end of the relevant block, such as a class or method definition. If a test should live within a class then the insertion happens BEFORE the last delimiter (if relevant).

Here is the file that contains the existing tests, called `test_app.py`. Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the structure of the file. Those numbers are not a part of the original code.

Now, you need to analyze the test file and provide a YAML object equivalent to type $TestsAnalysis, according to the following Pydantic definitions:
=====
class TestsAnalysis(BaseModel):
    language: str = Field(description="The programming language used by the test file")
    testing_framework: str = Field(description="The testing framework needed to run the tests in the test file")
    number_of_tests: int = Field(description="The number of tests in the test file")
    relevant_line_number_to_insert_tests_after: int = Field(description="The line number in the test file, **after which** the new tests should be inserted, so they will be a part of the existing test suite. Place the new tests after the last test in the suite.")
    relevant_line_number_to_insert_imports_after: int = Field(description="The line number in the test file, **after which**  new imports should be inserted, so they will be a legal valid code, and the new test file will be able to run. The new imports should be introduced as independent import lines, and not as part of the existing imports.")
=====


Example output:

```yaml
language: python
testing_framework: ...
number_of_tests: ...
relevant_line_number_to_insert_tests_after: ...
relevant_line_number_to_insert_imports_after: ...
```

The Response should be only a valid YAML object, without any introduction text or follow-up text.

user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `app.py`.
Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the code coverage report.
Those numbers are not a part of the original code.

        [0, 0, 0, 0],

    assert actual_path == expected_path, f"Expected {expected_path}, but got {actual_path}"
=========


### Test Framework
The test framework used for running tests is `pytest`.
If the current tests are part of a class and contain a 'self' input, than the generated tests should also include the `self` parameter in the test function signature.


## Code Coverage
Based on the code coverage report below, your goal is to suggest new test cases for the test file `test_app.py` against the source file `app.py` that would increase the coverage, meaning cover missing lines of code.
=========
Lines covered: [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 14, 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 39, 40, 41, 43, 44, 45, 47, 48, 50, 51, 53, 55, 56, 57, 59, 60, 61, 64, 68, 71, 73]
Lines missed: [69]
Percentage covered: 97.96%
=========


## Response
The output must be a YAML object equivalent to type $NewTests, according to the following Pydantic definitions:

    lines_to_cover: str = Field(description="A list of line numbers, currently uncovered, that this specific new test aims to cover")
    test_name: str = Field(description=" A short test name, in snake case, that reflects the behaviour to test")
    test_code: str = Field(description="A new 'pytest' test function that extends the existing test suite, and tests the behavior described in 'test_behavior'. The test should be a written like its a part of the existing test suite, if there is one, and it can use existing helper functions, setup, or teardown code. Don't iclude new imports here, use 'new_imports_code' section instead.")
    new_imports_code: str = Field(description="New imports that are required to run the new test function, and are not already imported in the test file. Give an empty string if no new imports are required. If relevant, add new imports as  'import ...' lines.")
    test_tags: str = Field(description="A single label that best describes the test, out of: ['happy path', 'edge case','other']")

class NewTests(BaseModel):
    language: str = Field(description="The programming language of the source code")
    existing_test_function_signature: str = Field(description="A single line repeating a signature header of one of the existing test functions")
    new_tests: List[SingleTest] = Field(min_items=1, max_items=4, description="A list of new test functions to append to the existing test suite, aiming to increase the code coverage. Each test should run as-is, without requiring any additional inputs or setup code. Don't introduce new dependencies")
=====


Example output:

```yaml
language: python
existing_test_function_signature: |
  ...
new_tests:
- test_behavior: |
    Test that the function returns the correct output for a single element list
  lines_to_cover: |
