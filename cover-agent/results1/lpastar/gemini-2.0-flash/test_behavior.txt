Test Behavior: Test the LazyPQ class's top() and pop() methods when the queue is empty.

Test Behavior: Test LPAStar with dynamic obstacles discovered over time. This test covers the scenario where obstacles are added at specific time steps, influencing the path planning.

Test Behavior: Test LPAStar when no valid predecessor is found in get_new_path, causing the path reconstruction to break.

Test Behavior: Test the C function when either s1 or s2 is an obstacle.

Test Behavior: Test the scenario where start and goal are the same. This should result in a trivial path.

Test Behavior: Test LPAStar with a larger grid and verifies that the algorithm finds a path.

Test Behavior: Test the LazyPQ class when an element is inserted, removed, and then the queue is cleared.

Test Behavior: Test the print_path function to ensure it does not raise any exceptions.

Test Behavior: Test the case when no valid predecessor is found in `get_new_path`, resulting in an incomplete path.

Test Behavior: Test the `C` function when either `s1` or `s2` is an obstacle.
