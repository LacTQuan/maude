Okay, I need to analyze the given test file and provide a YAML object with specific information. Let me go through each requirement step by step.

First, the programming language. The file starts with a shebang line for python3, and all the code is written in Python. So the language is definitely Python.

Next, the testing framework. The file has a docstring mentioning that it's using pytest. Also, the functions are named with 'test_' prefixes, which is typical for pytest. There's no import statement for unittest or other frameworks, so it's safe to say the testing framework is pytest.

Now, the number of tests. Looking at the code, I see two functions: test_path_found and test_no_path. Both start with 'def test_', so each is a test. That makes two tests in total.

Lastly, the indentation of the test headers. I check the lines where the test functions are defined. Both start with 'def' at the beginning of the line, so there's no leading whitespace. That means the indentation is 0.

Putting it all together, the YAML should reflect these findings.

```yaml
language: python
testing_framework: pytest
number_of_tests: 2
test_headers_indentation: 0
```

Okay, I need to analyze the given Python test file and provide a YAML object with specific information. Let me go through the file step by step.

First, the file is written in Python, so the language is definitely Python. That's straightforward.

Next, I need to determine the testing framework. Looking at the code, I see that there are functions named test_path_found and test_no_path. These are typical of pytest, where test functions start with 'test'. Also, there's no explicit import of unittest or other frameworks, so it's safe to assume that pytest is the testing framework used here.

Now, counting the number of tests. I see two test functions: test_path_found and test_no_path. So the number_of_tests is 2.

For the relevant_line_number_to_insert_tests_after, I need to find where to place a new test. The existing tests end at line 42. The next line is line 43, which is an assert. Wait, no, looking back, the file ends at line 44. So the last test function ends at line 42, and the file ends at line 44. So the new test should be inserted after the last test, which is line 42. But wait, line 43 is part of test_no_path. So the last test function ends at line 42, and the next line is line 43, which is the assert. Hmm, maybe I should check the structure again.

Wait, the test_no_path function starts at line 30 and ends at line 42. So the last line of the test is line 42. The file then ends at line 44. So to insert a new test, it should go after line 42, which is the end of the last test. So the relevant_line_number_to_insert_tests_after is 42.

Wait, but in the example, the insertion is after the last test. So if the last test ends at line 42, the new test should be inserted after that, so the line number would be 43. But in the given file, line 43 is part of test_no_path. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check the structure again.

Looking at the code, test_path_found is from line 14 to 28, and test_no_path is from line 30 to 42. So the last test ends at line 42. The next line is line 43, which is the assert in test_no_path. Wait, no, line 42 is the end of test_no_path. So after line 42, the next line is 43, which is the end of the file. So to insert a new test, it should be before the end of the file, but after the last test. So the insertion point is after line 42, which is the end of the last test. So the relevant_line_number_to_insert_tests_after is 42.

Wait, but in the example, the insertion is after the last test. So if the last test ends at line 42, the new test should be inserted at line 43. But in the given file, line 43 is the end of the file. So perhaps the correct line number is 43, but that's the end of the file. Alternatively, maybe the insertion should be before the last line. Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the new test should be added after the last test function, so after line 42. So the insertion line is 43, but since the file ends at 44, maybe it's better to insert before the last line. Wait, the file has line 44 as the end. So the new test should be inserted after line 42, which is the end of the last test. So the relevant_line_number_to_insert_tests_after is 42.

Wait, but in the example, the insertion is after the last test. So if the last test ends at line 42, the new test should be inserted at line 43. But in the given file, line 43 is part of test_no_path. No, wait, line 42 is the end of test_no_path. So line 43 is the next line, which is the end of the file. So the new test should be inserted at line 43, but that's the end. So perhaps the correct line is 43, but that's the last line. Alternatively, maybe the insertion should be before the last line, which is line 44. So the relevant_line_number_to_insert_tests_after is 43, but that's the end. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key is to insert the new test after the last test function, so after line 42. So the line number to insert after is 42.

Now, for the imports. The existing imports are at lines 8, 11, and 12. The new imports should be inserted after the existing imports. The existing imports end at line 12. So the relevant_line_number_to_insert_imports_after is 12. That way, any new imports will be added after line 12, keeping the import section together.

So putting it all together:

- language: python
- testing_framework: pytest
- number_of_tests: 2
- relevant_line_number_to_insert_tests_after: 42
- relevant_line_number_to_insert_imports_after: 12

Wait, but in the example, the relevant_line_number_to_insert_tests_after is 42, which is correct because the last test ends at 42. So the new test should be inserted after that line, which is line 43. But in the given file, line 43 is the end of the file. So perhaps the insertion should be at line 43, but that's the last line. Alternatively, maybe the line number is 43, but that's the end. Hmm, perhaps I should set it to 43, but that's the end of the file. Alternatively, maybe the line number is 42, and the new test is inserted after that line, which is line 43. So the relevant_line_number_to_insert_tests_after is 42.

Yes, that makes sense. So the new test will be inserted after line 42, which is the end of the last test function. So the line number is 42.
</think>

```yaml
language: python
testing_framework: pytest
number_of_tests: 2
relevant_line_number_to_insert_tests_after: 42
relevant_line_number_to_insert_imports_after: 12
```
<think>
Okay, I need to help generate additional unit tests to increase code coverage for the given Python source file. The existing tests are in test_app.py, and they currently cover about 81.4% of the code. My goal is to identify which lines are missing and create new tests that target those lines.

First, I'll look at the code coverage report. The lines missed are: [85, 90, 91, 92, 93, 122, 142, 150, 177, 178, 209, 251, 252, 253, 254, 259, 260, 261, 262, 263, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 275, 296, 336, 337, 348, 349, 350, 353, 354, 355, 356, 357, 358, 361, 362, 364, 365, 366, 369, 376, 377, 378, 379].

I'll go through each of these lines to understand what they do and how to test them.

Starting with line 85: it's the make_grid function, which is a dummy function. The test should call this function and check if it doesn't modify the grid.

Lines 90-93 are in print_path. The existing tests might not be calling this function, so a test that triggers print_path would cover these lines.

Line 122 is in the LazyPQ's remove method. Testing the remove functionality would cover this.

Line 142 is the top method, which is already covered, but perhaps edge cases like an empty queue aren't tested yet.

Line 150 is the pop method, which is covered, but maybe when the queue is empty, it raises an error. Testing that scenario would cover line 150.

Lines 177-178 are in set_dynamic_obstacles. The existing tests might not be setting dynamic obstacles, so a test that enables this would cover these lines.

Line 209 is in the C function. Testing when the cost is infinite, like when nodes are obstacles, would cover this.

Lines 251-254 are in compute_shortest_path, handling the else case where g > rhs. Testing this scenario would cover these lines.

Lines 259-263 are in detect_changes, handling discovered obstacles. Testing dynamic obstacles being added would cover these.

Lines 265-269 are also in detect_changes, handling random obstacles. Enabling create_random_obstacles and testing would cover these.

Line 275 is in clear_path_display, which marks nodes as explored. Testing path clearing would cover this.

Line 296 is in get_new_path when no predecessor is found. Testing a scenario where the path is broken would cover this.

Lines 336-337 are in detect_changes, adding obstacles. Testing dynamic changes would cover these.

Lines 348-379 are in the main routine, which isn't tested by the existing tests. Testing the main function's execution would cover these, but since it's a script, perhaps the tests should mock it or call the plan function with specific parameters.

Now, I'll brainstorm test cases:

1. Test make_grid: Create a grid, call make_grid, and assert it doesn't change.
2. Test print_path: Plan a path and trigger print_path to ensure it's called.
3. Test remove from LazyPQ: Insert a node, remove it, and check it's not in the queue.
4. Test detect_changes with dynamic obstacles: Set time_discovered_obstacles and check if obstacles are added.
5. Test C function with obstacles: Create a scenario where nodes are obstacles and assert the cost is infinite.
6. Test compute_shortest_path else case: Manipulate g and rhs to trigger the else condition.
7. Test random obstacles: Enable create_random_obstacles and check if obstacles are added over time.
8. Test clear_path_display: Plan a path, clear it, and check the grid marks.
9. Test get_new_path with no predecessor: Create a broken path and check it returns None or handles it.
10. Test main routine: Perhaps mock the main function or test the plan function with specific start and goal.

I'll prioritize tests that cover the most lines first. For example, testing detect_changes with dynamic obstacles would cover multiple lines. Similarly, testing the main routine might cover several lines, but it's more complex.

I'll outline each test:

- Test 1: Test make_grid. This is straightforward. Create a grid, call make_grid, and assert the grid remains the same.

- Test 2: Test print_path. Plan a path and call print_path to see if it's correctly handled.

- Test 3: Test LazyPQ remove. Insert a node, remove it, and check if it's no longer in the queue.

- Test 4: Test detect_changes with dynamic obstacles. Set time_discovered_obstacles and check if obstacles are added at specific time steps.

- Test 5: Test C function with obstacles. Create nodes that are obstacles and assert the cost is infinite.

- Test 6: Test compute_shortest_path else case. Manipulate g and rhs to be unequal and see if the else block is executed.

- Test 7: Test random obstacles. Enable create_random_obstacles and run the planner to see if obstacles are added randomly.

- Test 8: Test clear_path_display. Plan a path, clear it, and check the grid cells are marked correctly.

- Test 9: Test get_new_path with no predecessor. Create a scenario where a node has no predecessors and see if the path is handled correctly.

- Test 10: Test main routine. Perhaps test the plan function with specific start and goal, but since the main routine is called when the script runs, it's better to test the plan function directly.

I'll select the top five tests that cover the most lines and are feasible to implement.

For each test, I'll write the test function, ensuring it's part of the existing test suite, uses the same imports, and follows the same structure.

For example, test_make_grid will create a grid, call make_grid, and assert the grid is unchanged. This covers line 85.

Test_print_path will plan a path and call print_path, covering lines 90-93.

Test_lazy_pq_remove will test inserting and removing a node, covering lines 122 and 142.

Test_detect_changes will set dynamic obstacles and check if they're added, covering lines 259-263 and 265-269.

Test_c_function_obstacles will create obstacle nodes and assert the cost is infinite, covering line 209.

Each test will be written as a pytest function, using the existing imports, and named appropriately.

I'll ensure that each test function is self-contained, sets up its own grid and nodes, and doesn't rely on external state.

Finally, I'll make sure the new tests are added to the test file, increasing the code coverage.

Okay, I need to generate new tests to cover the uncovered lines in `app.py` and increase code coverage. Let me look at the code coverage report to see which lines are missed.

The lines missed include 85, 90-93, 122, 142, 150, 177-178, 209, 251-254, 259-263, 265-269, 275, 296, 336-337, and others. I'll need to create tests that target these lines.

Starting with line 85: it's the `make_grid` function. I remember that in the previous test, `make_grid` wasn't imported, but now I need to test it. Since `make_grid` is a dummy function that does nothing, I can test that it doesn't modify the input grid.

Next, lines 90-93 are in `print_path`. I can write a test that calls `print_path` and checks the output using `capsys` to capture the printed messages.

For line 122 in `LazyPQ.insert`, I can test inserting a node and then removing it, ensuring it's no longer in the priority queue.

Line 142 is in `LazyPQ.top`, so I can test popping all elements and ensuring it raises a KeyError when empty.

Line 150 is in `LazyPQ.pop`, so I can test popping elements and ensuring they're removed correctly.

Lines 177-178 are in `LPAStar.set_dynamic_obstacles`, so I can test setting these properties and ensure they're correctly assigned.

Line 209 is in `LPAStar.C`, testing the cost between two obstacle nodes should return infinity.

Lines 251-254 are in `LPAStar.compute_shortest_path`, so I can test scenarios where the g and rhs values are updated correctly.

Lines 259-263 and 265-269 are in `LPAStar.detect_changes`, so I can test adding random obstacles and ensure the grid is updated.

Line 275 is in `LPAStar.clear_path_display`, so I can test that it marks the path correctly.

Line 296 is in `LPAStar.get_new_path`, so I can test that it returns the correct path when no predecessors are found.

I'll create tests for each of these scenarios, ensuring each test covers specific lines and increases coverage. I'll also make sure to import any necessary functions and use appropriate test tags.

Okay, I need to generate new tests to increase code coverage for the `app.py` file. Let me look at the code coverage report to see which lines are missing.

The lines missed include 85, 90-93, 122, 142, 150, 177-178, 209, 251-254, 259-263, 265-269, 275, 296, 336-337, and others. I'll focus on these lines to create meaningful tests.

1. **Test for `make_grid` Function (Line 85):**
   - The `make_grid` function is supposed to mimic the C++ MakeGrid() but currently does nothing. I'll test that it doesn't modify the input grid.

2. **Test `print_path` Function (Lines 90-93):**
   - Ensure that `print_path` correctly prints the path without errors.

3. **Test `LazyPQ` Remove Function (Lines 122, 142):**
   - Verify that removing a node from the priority queue works as expected.

4. **Test `C` Function with Obstacles (Line 209):**
   - Confirm that the cost is infinite when moving through obstacles.

5. **Test `detect_changes` Function (Lines 259-263, 265-269):**
   - Ensure dynamic obstacles are correctly detected and added.

6. **Test Edge Cases in `compute_shortest_path` (Lines 251-254):**
   - Check handling of cases where g > rhs or g is updated.

7. **Test Path Reconstruction (Lines 296, 336-337):**
   - Verify that the path is correctly reconstructed from the goal node.

8. **Test Node Initialization and Methods (Lines 348-379):**
   - Ensure nodes are initialized correctly and methods like `print_status` work.

I'll create tests for each of these areas, ensuring they cover the missed lines and increase overall coverage.

Okay, I need to help the user by generating new tests to increase code coverage for their Python project. The user provided the source file `app.py` and the existing test file `test_app.py`. The goal is to add comprehensive unit tests that cover the previously missed lines of code.

First, I'll analyze the code coverage report. The report shows that several lines in `app.py` are not covered by the existing tests. My task is to identify these lines and create new test cases that target them.

Looking at the missed lines, I notice that some are in the `Node` class, the `LazyPQ` class, and the `LPAStar` class. I'll need to write tests that exercise these parts of the code.

For the `Node` class, I see that lines 85, 90-93 are missed. These lines relate to the `make_grid` function and the `print_path` function. I'll create a test that calls `make_grid` and another that tests `print_path` to ensure these functions are covered.

Next, for the `LazyPQ` class, lines 122 and 142 are missed. These lines are part of the `remove` method and the `top` method. I'll write tests that check if nodes can be removed and if the priority queue behaves correctly after removal.

In the `LPAStar` class, several lines are missed, including parts of the `detect_changes` method and the `compute_shortest_path` method. I'll create tests that simulate dynamic obstacles and check if the path reconstruction works correctly.

I'll structure each new test function to cover specific behaviors, ensuring that they follow the existing test suite's style and structure. Each test will have a clear name, describe the behavior it tests, and target specific lines of code that were previously uncovered.

Finally, I'll make sure that all new tests are added to the `test_app.py` file and that they import any necessary modules. I'll also ensure that the tests are properly formatted and don't introduce any syntax errors.

Okay, I need to figure out how to increase the code coverage for the `app.py` file by adding new tests to `test_app.py`. The current coverage is 81.4%, and there are some lines that aren't covered. I'll look at the lines missed and think about what test cases can cover them.

Looking at the lines missed, I see lines like 85, which is the `make_grid function`. I remember that `make_grid` is a dummy function that doesn't do anything, but it's supposed to mimic a C++ function. So a test could check that it doesn't modify the input grid.

Another set of lines are around the `C` function, specifically lines 209, 251-254. The `C` function calculates the cost between nodes, so I should test cases where nodes are obstacles or when the cost is correctly calculated.

Lines 259-269 are part of the `detect_changes method`, which adds dynamic obstacles. I should test that this method correctly adds obstacles when `create_random_obstacles` is enabled.

Lines 296-336 are in the `get_new_path` method, which constructs the path. I should test that the path is correctly built, especially edge cases where the path is empty or has loops.

Lines 348-379 are in the `__main__` block, which initializes the grid and runs the planner. I should test the main function's output to ensure it works as expected.

I'll create tests for each of these areas to cover the missed lines and improve coverage.
</think>

To increase code coverage, I'll add tests for the uncovered lines in `app.py`.

Okay, I need to figure out how to increase the code coverage for the given source file `app.py` by adding new tests to `test_app.py`. The current coverage is 81.4%, so I need to identify the lines that are not yet covered and write tests for them.

Looking at the code coverage report, the lines not covered include:

- Line 85: `make_grid` function
- Lines 90-93: `print_path` function
- Lines 122, 142: parts of the `LazyPQ` class
- Line 150: `set_dynamic_obstacles` method
- Lines 177-178: `create_random_obstacles` parameter
- Line 209: `C` function's return value
- Lines 251-254: `compute_shortest_path` loop conditions
- Lines 259-269: `detect_changes` method
- Lines 275: `clear_path_display` method
- Lines 296-300: `get_new_path` method
- Lines 336-337: `get_new_path` loop
- Lines 348-379: `__main__` block

I'll need to write tests that cover these lines. Let's go through each and think about what kind of test would cover them.

1. **Line 85: `make_grid` function**
   - This function is supposed to mimic the C++ MakeGrid function but does nothing in the Python version. A test should verify that calling `make_grid` doesn't modify the input grid.

2. **Lines 90-93: `print_path` function**
   - This function prints the path from start to goal. A test should call `print_path` and check that it outputs the correct path.

3. **Lines 122, 142: `LazyPQ` methods**
   - These lines are part of the `remove` and `top` methods. Tests should verify that removing a node works correctly and that the top method returns the correct node.

4. **Line 150: `set_dynamic_obstacles` method**
   - This method sets whether dynamic obstacles are created and passes a dictionary of discovered obstacles. A test should verify that obstacles are correctly added over time.

5. **Lines 177-178: `create_random_obstacles` parameter**
   - This parameter controls whether random obstacles are created. A test should enable this and check that obstacles are added.

6. **Line 209: `C` function's return value**
   - This function calculates the cost between two nodes. A test should verify that the cost is correctly calculated, especially for diagonal movements if applicable.

7. **Lines 251-254: `compute_shortest_path` loop conditions**
   - These lines handle the loop that processes nodes. Tests should cover scenarios where the loop correctly updates node costs and exits when the goal is reached.

8. **Lines 259-269: `detect_changes` method**
   - This method adds dynamic obstacles. Tests should verify that obstacles are correctly added and nodes are updated.

9. **Line 275: `clear_path_display` method**
   - This method clears the path display. A test should verify that the grid is updated correctly after path clearance.

10. **Lines 296-300: `get_new_path` method**
    - This method reconstructs the path from goal to start. Tests should verify that the path is correctly reconstructed and that parent IDs are set properly.

11. **Lines 336-337: `get_new_path` loop**
    - This loop backtracks from the goal to the start. Tests should cover this loop to ensure it correctly builds the path.

12. **Lines 348-379: `__main__` block**
    - This block initializes the grid, start, and goal, and runs the planner. Tests should cover the main execution flow, including setting up the environment and handling dynamic obstacles.

Now, I'll outline the new tests needed to cover these lines.

1. **Test `make_grid` function:**
   - Create a grid, call `make_grid,` and assert the grid remains unchanged.

2. **Test `print_path` function:**
   - Call `print_path` with a sample path and check the output.

3. **Test `LazyPQ` remove and top methods:**
   - Insert a node, remove it, and assert it's no longer present. Then call `top` and assert it raises an error.

4. **Test `set_dynamic_obstacles` method:**
   - Set dynamic obstacles and verify that obstacles are added at specific time steps.

5. **Test `create_random_obstacles` parameter:**
   - Enable random obstacles and check that an obstacle is added.

6. **Test `C` function's return value:**
   - Test with different node positions and assert the cost is correct.

7. **Test `compute_shortest_path` loop conditions:**
   - Create a scenario where the loop exits early when the goal is reached.

8. **Test `detect_changes` method:**
   - Enable dynamic obstacles and verify that obstacles are added and the grid is updated.

9. **Test `clear_path_display` method:**
   - Call the method with a path and assert the grid is cleared.

10. **Test `get_new_path` method:**
    - Call the method and assert the path is correctly reconstructed.

11. **Test `__main__` block:**
    - Run the main block and assert that the planner initializes and runs correctly.

By writing these tests, we can increase the code coverage and ensure all parts of the code are thoroughly tested.
</think>

To increase code coverage, we'll add tests targeting the uncovered lines in `app.py`. Each test will focus on specific functionalities to ensure comprehensive validation.

Alright, I need to figure out how to increase the code coverage for the app.py file by adding new tests. The current coverage is 81.4%, and there are several lines that aren't covered. My goal is to create new test functions that target these missed lines.

First, I'll look at the lines that are already covered and the ones that aren't. The lines missed include parts of the `__init__` method, the `H` function, the `get_neighbours` method, and others. I need to create tests that exercise these parts of the code.

I'll start by identifying what each of these lines does. For example, line 85 is the `make_grid function`, which is a dummy function. Testing this would involve calling it and ensuring it doesn't modify the input grid.

Next, I'll think about the `H` function, which calculates the heuristic using the Euclidean distance. A test here would pass two nodes and check if the heuristic matches the expected value.

For the `get_neighbours` method, I'll test it by providing a node and checking if it returns the correct list of neighboring nodes.

I'll also need to test the `clear_path_display` and `update_path_display` methods to ensure they correctly modify the grid's display.

I'll create separate test functions for each of these, ensuring each test is concise and targets specific lines. I'll also make sure to import any necessary functions and use appropriate tags for each test.

Finally, I'll structure these tests in a YAML format as specified, ensuring each test covers the missed lines and increases the overall code coverage.

Okay, I need to create a YAML response that suggests new tests to increase code coverage for the app.py file. The user provided the existing test file and the code coverage report, which shows that some lines are not covered.

First, I'll look at the lines that are not covered. These include lines like 85, 90-93, 122, 142, etc. I need to create new test functions that cover these lines.

I'll start by identifying which functions in app.py are not adequately tested. For example, the make_grid function is a dummy and isn't tested. So I'll create a test to check if it doesn't modify the input grid.

Next, the print_path function is only partially covered. I'll write a test that calls it with a valid path and checks the output.

The get_neighbours function isn't fully tested, so I'll create a test to ensure it returns the correct number of neighbors for a given node.

The clear_path_display and update_path_display functions have some lines not covered. I'll write tests to ensure they correctly clear and update the path in the grid.

I'll also test the H function to ensure it calculates the heuristic correctly for different nodes.

For each new test, I'll provide the test_behavior, lines_to_cover, test_name, test_code, new_imports_code, and test_tags. I'll make sure the test_code is a valid pytest function that can be added to the existing test suite.

Finally, I'll structure all these tests into a YAML format as per the user's instructions, ensuring each test is correctly formatted and covers the necessary lines.

Okay, I need to suggest new test cases to increase the code coverage of the `app.py` file. The current coverage is 81.4%, with some lines still uncovered. My goal is to identify which parts of the code aren't being tested and write new tests to cover those lines.

Looking at the code coverage report, the lines that are missing include:

- Line 85: The `make_grid function`
- Lines 90-93: The `print_path function`
- Lines 122 and 142: Parts of the `LazyPQ` class
- Lines 150: The `pop` method in `LazyPQ`
- Line 177-178: The `set_dynamic_obstacles` method
- Lines 209: The `C` function
- Lines 251-254: The `compute_shortest_path` method
- Lines 259-263: The `detect_changes method`
- Line 275: The `clear_path_display` method
- Lines 296-302: The `get_new_path` method
- Lines 336-337: The `get_new_path` method
- Lines 348-379: The `__main__` block

I'll go through each of these areas and think about what tests are needed.

1. **make_grid function (Line 85):**
   - This function is supposed to mimic the C++ MakeGrid function but does nothing in Python. A test should verify that it doesn't modify the input grid.

2. **print_path function (Lines 90-93):**
   - This function prints the path. A test should check that it correctly prints the path and that the output contains the expected message.

3. **LazyPQ class (Lines 122, 142, 150):**
   - The `remove` and `top` methods need more coverage. Tests should verify that removing a node works correctly and that the top method raises an error when the queue is empty.

4. **set_dynamic_obstacles method (Lines 177-178):**
   - This method sets dynamic obstacles. A test should verify that it correctly sets the `create_random_obstacles` flag and the `time_discovered_obstacles` dictionary.

5. **C function (Line 209):**
   - This function calculates the cost between nodes. Tests should cover cases where nodes are obstacles and where they aren't.

6. **compute_shortest_path method (Lines 251-254):**
   - This method handles the main loop of the LPA* algorithm. Tests should cover scenarios where the goal is reached and where it's not.

7. **detect_changes method (Lines 259-263):**
   - This method detects dynamic obstacles. Tests should verify that it correctly adds obstacles at specific times.

8. **clear_path_display method (Line 275):**
   - This method clears the path display. Tests should ensure that it correctly resets the grid cells.

9. **get_new_path method (Lines 296-302):**
   - This method reconstructs the path. Tests should verify that it correctly builds the path and handles edge cases.

10. **__main__ block (Lines 348-379):**
    - This block runs the planner when the script is executed. Tests should cover the main execution flow.

Based on this analysis, I'll create new test cases for each of these areas to ensure full coverage.

Okay, I need to create a YAML response that suggests new test cases to increase code coverage for the app.py file. The user has provided the code and the current test coverage, which shows that some lines are not covered.

First, I'll look at the lines that are missing coverage. These include lines like 85, 90-93, 122, 142, etc. I need to create tests that cover these lines.

Looking at line 85 in app.py, it's the make_grid function, which is a dummy function. I should test that it doesn't modify the input grid.

For lines 90-93 in app.py, the print_path function is supposed to print the path. I should test that it correctly prints the path when given a valid path, an empty path, and when no path is found.

Lines 122 and 142 in app.py are part of the LazyPQ class. I need to test the remove function to ensure it correctly removes nodes and that the priority queue behaves as expected after removal.

I'll create separate test functions for each of these cases, ensuring that each test covers the specific lines and increases the overall coverage.

I'll structure each test with a clear description, the lines it covers, and the appropriate test code. I'll also ensure that the tests are properly tagged and don't require any new imports unless necessary.

Finally, I'll format the response as a YAML object, listing each new test case with all required fields.
