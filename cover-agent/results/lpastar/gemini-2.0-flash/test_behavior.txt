Test Behavior: Test the LazyPQ class's top() method when the queue is empty. This should raise a KeyError.

Test Behavior: Test the LazyPQ class's pop() method when the queue is empty. This should raise a KeyError.

Test Behavior: Test LPAStar with dynamic obstacles discovered over time. This test covers the scenario where obstacles are added during the planning process, forcing the planner to adapt.

Test Behavior: Test LPAStar when no valid predecessor is found during path retrieval. This can happen if the path is blocked or the goal is unreachable.

Test Behavior: Test LPAStar with random obstacles enabled. This test checks if the planner can handle dynamically changing environments by creating random obstacles during the planning process.
