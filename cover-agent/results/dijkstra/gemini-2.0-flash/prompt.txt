Now, you need to analyze the test file and provide a YAML object equivalent to type $TestsAnalysis, according to the following Pydantic definitions:
=====

class TestsAnalysis(BaseModel):
    language: str = Field(description="The programming language used by the test file")
    testing_framework: str = Field(description="The testing framework needed to run the tests in the test file")
    number_of_tests: int = Field(description="The number of tests in the test file")
    test_headers_indentation: int = Field(description="The indentation of the test headers in the test file.For example, "def test_..." has an indentation of 0, "  def test_..." has an indentation of 2, "    def test_..." has an indentation of 4, and so on.")

You are a code assistant that accepts a python test file as input.
Your goal is to analyze this file and provide the following: 
* The programming language of the test file
* The testing framework needed to run the tests in the test file
* The number of tests in the test file
* The line number in the test file where the new test should be inserted. 

IMPORTANT: Ensure that you account for block delimiters (e.g., curly braces in Java, `end` in Ruby) to correctly place the new test before the end of the relevant block, such as a class or method definition. If a test should live within a class then the insertion happens BEFORE the last delimiter (if relevant).

user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

## Source File

### Test Framework
The test framework used for running tests is `pytest`.
If the current tests are part of a class and contain a 'self' input, than the generated tests should also include the `self` parameter in the test function signature.


## Code Coverage
Based on the code coverage report below, your goal is to suggest new test cases for the test file `test_app.py` against the source file `app.py` that would increase the coverage, meaning cover missing lines of code.
=========
Lines covered: [1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 51, 52, 54, 55, 56, 58, 59, 60, 62, 70, 71, 72, 73, 76, 79, 80, 82, 85, 86, 89, 90, 91, 92, 95, 98, 99, 100, 101, 103, 104, 107, 108, 109, 111, 112, 114, 115, 117, 119, 122, 124, 129, 131, 132, 133, 134, 136, 140, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 154, 156, 157, 159]
Lines missed: [49, 137, 138, 152, 153, 161, 162, 166, 167, 170, 171, 172, 175, 176, 178, 179, 181, 182, 183, 184]

Short and concise analysis of why the test run failed, and and recommended Fixes (dont add any other information):

system: 
user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `app.py`.

Test execution error analysis:
**Analysis:**

The test `test_unreachable_goal` failed because the assertion `path == []` was not met. The test expected an empty path when the goal is blocked after the search starts, but the algorithm returned a non-empty path.

**Recommended Fixes:**

1.  Modify the `plan` method in `Dijkstra` to return an empty path when the goal is unreachable during path reconstruction.
2.  Ensure the `convert_closed_list_to_path` function correctly handles cases where the path to the goal cannot be reconstructed due to obstacles.

Short and concise analysis of why the test run failed, and and recommended Fixes (dont add any other information):

system: 
user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `app.py`.
Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the code coverage report.
Those numbers are not a part of the original code.

### Test Framework
The test framework used for running tests is `pytest`.
If the current tests are part of a class and contain a 'self' input, than the generated tests should also include the `self` parameter in the test function signature.

Test execution error analysis:
**Analysis:**

The test `test_unreachable_goal` failed because the assertion `path == []` was not met. The test expected an empty path when the goal is blocked after the search starts, but the algorithm returned a non-empty path.

**Recommended Fixes:**

1.  Modify the `plan` method in `Dijkstra` to return an empty path when the goal is unreachable during path reconstruction.
2.  Ensure the `convert_closed_list_to_path` function correctly handles cases where the path to the goal cannot be reconstructed due to obstacles.

```
Test execution error analysis:
**Analysis:**

The test `test_unreachable_goal` failed because the assertion `assert found is False` evaluated to `False`. This indicates that the Dijkstra algorithm incorrectly found a path to the goal when it should have been unreachable due to obstacles.

**Recommended Fixes:**

1.  **Debug the `plan` method:** Carefully review the logic in the `plan` method of the `Dijkstra` class, especially the neighbor exploration and obstacle avoidance sections, to ensure it correctly identifies and handles unreachable goals.
2.  **Check obstacle handling:** Verify that the code correctly identifies obstacles in the grid and prevents the algorithm from moving through them.
3.  **Review `compare_coordinates`:** Ensure the `compare_coordinates` function is working as expected.

Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `app.py`.
Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the code coverage report.
Those numbers are not a part of the original code.

### Test Framework
The test framework used for running tests is `pytest`.
If the current tests are part of a class and contain a 'self' input, than the generated tests should also include the `self` parameter in the test function signature.

Test execution error analysis:
**Analysis:**

The test `test_unreachable_goal` failed because the assertion `path == []` was not met. The test expected an empty path when the goal is blocked after the search starts, but the algorithm returned a non-empty path.

**Recommended Fixes:**

1.  Modify the `plan` method in `Dijkstra` to return an empty path when the goal is unreachable during path reconstruction.
2.  Ensure the `convert_closed_list_to_path` function correctly handles cases where the path to the goal cannot be reconstructed due to obstacles.

Test execution error analysis:
**Analysis:**

The test `test_unreachable_goal` failed because the assertion `assert found is False` evaluated to `False`. This indicates that the Dijkstra algorithm incorrectly found a path to the goal when it should have been unreachable due to obstacles.

**Recommended Fixes:**

1.  **Debug the `plan` method:** Carefully review the logic in the `plan` method of the `Dijkstra` class, especially the neighbor exploration and obstacle avoidance sections, to ensure it correctly identifies and handles unreachable goals.
2.  **Check obstacle handling:** Verify that the code correctly identifies obstacles in the grid and prevents the algorithm from moving through them.
3.  **Review `compare_coordinates`:** Ensure the `compare_coordinates` function is working as expected.

Test execution error analysis:
**Analysis:**

The test `test_unreachable_goal_2x2` failed because the assertion `assert found is False` evaluated to `False`. This indicates that the Dijkstra planning algorithm incorrectly found a path in a scenario where the goal is unreachable due to obstacles.

**Recommended Fixes:**

1.  **Debug `Dijkstra.plan()`:** Examine the logic within the `plan` method, specifically how it handles obstacles and determines path existence. There might be a flaw in how the algorithm identifies or avoids obstacles, leading to a false positive.
2.  **Review Obstacle Check:** Ensure the `check_outside_boundary` function and the obstacle check (`self.grid[new_point.x][new_point.y] != 0`) are correctly implemented and used within the `plan` method.
3.  **Inspect Neighbor Exploration:** Verify that the neighbor exploration logic correctly skips blocked cells.

Short and concise analysis of why the test run failed, and and recommended Fixes (dont add any other information):

system: 
user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `app.py`.

Test execution error analysis:
**Analysis:**

The test `test_unreachable_goal` failed because the assertion `path == []` was not met. The test expected an empty path when the goal is blocked after the search starts, but the algorithm returned a non-empty path.

**Recommended Fixes:**

1.  Modify the `plan` method in `Dijkstra` to return an empty path when the goal is unreachable during path reconstruction.
2.  Ensure the `convert_closed_list_to_path` function correctly handles cases where the path to the goal cannot be reconstructed due to obstacles.

Test execution error analysis:
**Analysis:**

The test `test_unreachable_goal` failed because the assertion `assert found is False` evaluated to `False`. This indicates that the Dijkstra algorithm incorrectly found a path to the goal when it should have been unreachable due to obstacles.

**Recommended Fixes:**

1.  **Debug the `plan` method:** Carefully review the logic in the `plan` method of the `Dijkstra` class, especially the neighbor exploration and obstacle avoidance sections, to ensure it correctly identifies and handles unreachable goals.
2.  **Check obstacle handling:** Verify that the code correctly identifies obstacles in the grid and prevents the algorithm from moving through them.
3.  **Review `compare_coordinates`:** Ensure the `compare_coordinates` function is working as expected.

**Analysis:**

The test `test_unreachable_goal_2x2` failed because the assertion `assert found is False` evaluated to `False`. This indicates that the Dijkstra planning algorithm incorrectly found a path in a scenario where the goal is unreachable due to obstacles.

**Recommended Fixes:**

1.  **Debug `Dijkstra.plan()`:** Examine the logic within the `plan` method, specifically how it handles obstacles and determines path existence. There might be a flaw in how the algorithm identifies or avoids obstacles, leading to a false positive.
2.  **Review Obstacle Check:** Ensure the `check_outside_boundary` function and the obstacle check (`self.grid[new_point.x][new_point.y] != 0`) are correctly implemented and used within the `plan` method.
3.  **Inspect Neighbor Exploration:** Verify that the neighbor exploration logic correctly skips blocked cells.

Test execution error analysis:
**Analysis:**

The test `test_unreachable_goal_again` failed because the assertion `assert found is False` evaluated to `False`. This indicates that the Dijkstra algorithm incorrectly found a path to the goal when it should not have.

**Recommended Fixes:**

1.  **Debug the `plan` method:** Carefully review the logic in the `Dijkstra.plan` method, especially the neighbor exploration and obstacle checking, to ensure it correctly identifies when a goal is unreachable.
2.  **Review obstacle handling:** Double-check how obstacles are represented and handled in the grid. Ensure the algorithm correctly identifies and avoids them.
3.  **Inspect closed list conversion:** Verify the logic in `convert_closed_list_to_path` to ensure it correctly backtracks and doesn't introduce errors when no path exists.

Short and concise analysis of why the test run failed, and and recommended Fixes (dont add any other information):

system: 
user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

## Source File

Test execution error analysis:
**Analysis:**

The test `test_unreachable_goal` failed because the assertion `path == []` was not met. The test expected an empty path when the goal is blocked after the search starts, but the algorithm returned a non-empty path.

**Recommended Fixes:**

1.  Modify the `plan` method in `Dijkstra` to return an empty path when the goal is unreachable during path reconstruction.
2.  Ensure the `convert_closed_list_to_path` function correctly handles cases where the path to the goal cannot be reconstructed due to obstacles.

**Analysis:**

The test `test_unreachable_goal` failed because the assertion `assert found is False` evaluated to `False`. This indicates that the Dijkstra algorithm incorrectly found a path to the goal when it should have been unreachable due to obstacles.

**Recommended Fixes:**

1.  **Debug the `plan` method:** Carefully review the logic in the `plan` method of the `Dijkstra` class, especially the neighbor exploration and obstacle avoidance sections, to ensure it correctly identifies and handles unreachable goals.
2.  **Check obstacle handling:** Verify that the code correctly identifies obstacles in the grid and prevents the algorithm from moving through them.
3.  **Review `compare_coordinates`:** Ensure the `compare_coordinates` function is working as expected.

**Recommended Fixes:**

1.  **Debug `Dijkstra.plan()`:** Examine the logic within the `plan` method, specifically how it handles obstacles and determines path existence. There might be a flaw in how the algorithm identifies or avoids obstacles, leading to a false positive.
2.  **Review Obstacle Check:** Ensure the `check_outside_boundary` function and the obstacle check (`self.grid[new_point.x][new_point.y] != 0`) are correctly implemented and used within the `plan` method.
3.  **Inspect Neighbor Exploration:** Verify that the neighbor exploration logic correctly skips blocked cells.

Test execution error analysis:
**Analysis:**

The test `test_unreachable_goal_again` failed because the assertion `assert found is False` evaluated to `False`. This indicates that the Dijkstra algorithm incorrectly found a path to the goal when it should not have.

**Recommended Fixes:**

1.  **Debug the `plan` method:** Carefully review the logic in the `Dijkstra.plan` method, especially the neighbor exploration and obstacle checking, to ensure it correctly identifies when a goal is unreachable.
2.  **Review obstacle handling:** Double-check how obstacles are represented and handled in the grid. Ensure the algorithm correctly identifies and avoids them.
3.  **Inspect closed list conversion:** Verify the logic in `convert_closed_list_to_path` to ensure it correctly backtracks and doesn't introduce errors when no path exists.

**Analysis:**

The test `test_unreachable_goal` failed because the assertion `assert found is False` evaluated to `False`. This indicates that the Dijkstra algorithm incorrectly found a path to the goal when it should have been unreachable due to obstacles.

**Recommended Fixes:**

1.  **Debug `plan` method:** Examine the `plan` method in `app.py` to understand why it's finding a path when the goal is unreachable. Focus on the neighbor exploration and obstacle avoidance logic.
2.  **Review `convert_closed_list_to_path`:** Check the logic in `convert_closed_list_to_path` to ensure it correctly identifies the path.

user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `app.py`.
Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the code coverage report.
Those numbers are not a part of the original code.

Test execution error analysis:
**Analysis:**

The test `test_unreachable_goal` failed because the assertion `path == []` was not met. The test expected an empty path when the goal is blocked after the search starts, but the algorithm returned a non-empty path.

**Recommended Fixes:**

1.  Modify the `plan` method in `Dijkstra` to return an empty path when the goal is unreachable during path reconstruction.
2.  Ensure the `convert_closed_list_to_path` function correctly handles cases where the path to the goal cannot be reconstructed due to obstacles.

```
Test execution error analysis:
**Analysis:**

The test `test_unreachable_goal` failed because the assertion `assert found is False` evaluated to `False`. This indicates that the Dijkstra algorithm incorrectly found a path to the goal when it should have been unreachable due to obstacles.

**Recommended Fixes:**

1.  **Debug the `plan` method:** Carefully review the logic in the `plan` method of the `Dijkstra` class, especially the neighbor exploration and obstacle avoidance sections, to ensure it correctly identifies and handles unreachable goals.
2.  **Check obstacle handling:** Verify that the code correctly identifies obstacles in the grid and prevents the algorithm from moving through them.
3.  **Review `compare_coordinates`:** Ensure the `compare_coordinates` function is working as expected.

Test execution error analysis:
**Analysis:**

The test `test_unreachable_goal_2x2` failed because the assertion `assert found is False` evaluated to `False`. This indicates that the Dijkstra planning algorithm incorrectly found a path in a scenario where the goal is unreachable due to obstacles.

**Recommended Fixes:**

1.  **Debug `Dijkstra.plan()`:** Examine the logic within the `plan` method, specifically how it handles obstacles and determines path existence. There might be a flaw in how the algorithm identifies or avoids obstacles, leading to a false positive.
2.  **Review Obstacle Check:** Ensure the `check_outside_boundary` function and the obstacle check (`self.grid[new_point.x][new_point.y] != 0`) are correctly implemented and used within the `plan` method.
3.  **Inspect Neighbor Exploration:** Verify that the neighbor exploration logic correctly skips blocked cells.

Short and concise analysis of why the test run failed, and and recommended Fixes (dont add any other information):

system: 
user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `app.py`.
Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the code coverage report.
Those numbers are not a part of the original code.

### Test Framework
The test framework used for running tests is `pytest`.
If the current tests are part of a class and contain a 'self' input, than the generated tests should also include the `self` parameter in the test function signature.

Test execution error analysis:
**Analysis:**

The test `test_unreachable_goal` failed because the assertion `path == []` was not met. The test expected an empty path when the goal is blocked after the search starts, but the algorithm returned a non-empty path.

**Recommended Fixes:**

1.  Modify the `plan` method in `Dijkstra` to return an empty path when the goal is unreachable during path reconstruction.
2.  Ensure the `convert_closed_list_to_path` function correctly handles cases where the path to the goal cannot be reconstructed due to obstacles.

2.  **Check obstacle handling:** Verify that the code correctly identifies obstacles in the grid and prevents the algorithm from moving through them.
3.  **Review `compare_coordinates`:** Ensure the `compare_coordinates` function is working as expected.

**Recommended Fixes:**

1.  **Debug `Dijkstra.plan()`:** Examine the logic within the `plan` method, specifically how it handles obstacles and determines path existence. There might be a flaw in how the algorithm identifies or avoids obstacles, leading to a false positive.
2.  **Review Obstacle Check:** Ensure the `check_outside_boundary` function and the obstacle check (`self.grid[new_point.x][new_point.y] != 0`) are correctly implemented and used within the `plan` method.
3.  **Inspect Neighbor Exploration:** Verify that the neighbor exploration logic correctly skips blocked cells.

Short and concise analysis of why the test run failed, and and recommended Fixes (dont add any other information):

system: 
user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `app.py`.

Test execution error analysis:
**Analysis:**

The test `test_unreachable_goal` failed because the assertion `path == []` was not met. The test expected an empty path when the goal is blocked after the search starts, but the algorithm returned a non-empty path.

**Recommended Fixes:**

1.  Modify the `plan` method in `Dijkstra` to return an empty path when the goal is unreachable during path reconstruction.
2.  Ensure the `convert_closed_list_to_path` function correctly handles cases where the path to the goal cannot be reconstructed due to obstacles.

Test execution error analysis:
**Analysis:**

The test `test_unreachable_goal` failed because the assertion `assert found is False` evaluated to `False`. This indicates that the Dijkstra algorithm incorrectly found a path to the goal when it should have been unreachable due to obstacles.

**Recommended Fixes:**

1.  **Debug the `plan` method:** Carefully review the logic in the `plan` method of the `Dijkstra` class, especially the neighbor exploration and obstacle avoidance sections, to ensure it correctly identifies and handles unreachable goals.
2.  **Check obstacle handling:** Verify that the code correctly identifies obstacles in the grid and prevents the algorithm from moving through them.
3.  **Review `compare_coordinates`:** Ensure the `compare_coordinates` function is working as expected.

**Analysis:**

The test `test_unreachable_goal_2x2` failed because the assertion `assert found is False` evaluated to `False`. This indicates that the Dijkstra planning algorithm incorrectly found a path in a scenario where the goal is unreachable due to obstacles.

**Recommended Fixes:**

1.  **Debug `Dijkstra.plan()`:** Examine the logic within the `plan` method, specifically how it handles obstacles and determines path existence. There might be a flaw in how the algorithm identifies or avoids obstacles, leading to a false positive.
2.  **Review Obstacle Check:** Ensure the `check_outside_boundary` function and the obstacle check (`self.grid[new_point.x][new_point.y] != 0`) are correctly implemented and used within the `plan` method.
3.  **Inspect Neighbor Exploration:** Verify that the neighbor exploration logic correctly skips blocked cells.

3.  **Inspect closed list conversion:** Verify the logic in `convert_closed_list_to_path` to ensure it correctly backtracks and doesn't introduce errors when no path exists.

Test execution error analysis:
**Analysis:**

The test `test_unreachable_goal` failed because the assertion `assert found is False` evaluated to `False`. This indicates that the Dijkstra algorithm incorrectly found a path to the goal when it should have been unreachable due to obstacles.

**Recommended Fixes:**

1.  **Debug `plan` method:** Examine the `plan` method in `app.py` to understand why it's finding a path when the goal is unreachable. Focus on the neighbor exploration and obstacle avoidance logic.
2.  **Review `convert_closed_list_to_path`:** Check the logic in `convert_closed_list_to_path` to ensure it correctly identifies the path.
3.  **Verify Grid State:** Ensure the grid state is correctly reset between tests, and that the obstacle representation is accurate.

Short and concise analysis of why the test run failed, and and recommended Fixes (dont add any other information):

system: 
user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `app.py`.
Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the code coverage report.
Those numbers are not a part of the original code.

Test execution error analysis:
**Analysis:**

The test `test_unreachable_goal` failed because the assertion `path == []` was not met. The test expected an empty path when the goal is blocked after the search starts, but the algorithm returned a non-empty path.

**Recommended Fixes:**

1.  Modify the `plan` method in `Dijkstra` to return an empty path when the goal is unreachable during path reconstruction.
2.  Ensure the `convert_closed_list_to_path` function correctly handles cases where the path to the goal cannot be reconstructed due to obstacles.

**Recommended Fixes:**

1.  **Debug `Dijkstra.plan()`:** Examine the logic within the `plan` method, specifically how it handles obstacles and determines path existence. There might be a flaw in how the algorithm identifies or avoids obstacles, leading to a false positive.
2.  **Review Obstacle Check:** Ensure the `check_outside_boundary` function and the obstacle check (`self.grid[new_point.x][new_point.y] != 0`) are correctly implemented and used within the `plan` method.
3.  **Inspect Neighbor Exploration:** Verify that the neighbor exploration logic correctly skips blocked cells.

Test execution error analysis:
**Analysis:**

The test `test_unreachable_goal` failed because the assertion `assert found is False` evaluated to `False`. This indicates that the Dijkstra algorithm incorrectly found a path to the goal when it should have been unreachable due to obstacles.

**Recommended Fixes:**

1.  **Debug the `plan` method:** Carefully review the logic in the `Dijkstra.plan` method, especially the neighbor exploration and obstacle avoidance sections, to ensure it correctly identifies and handles unreachable goals.
2.  **Verify obstacle checking:** Double-check the `check_outside_boundary` function and the obstacle checking logic (`self.grid[new_point.x][new_point.y] != 0`) within the `plan` method to ensure they are functioning as expected.
