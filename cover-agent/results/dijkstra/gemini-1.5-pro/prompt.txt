Now, you need to analyze the test file and provide a YAML object equivalent to type $TestsAnalysis, according to the following Pydantic definitions:
=====

class TestsAnalysis(BaseModel):
    language: str = Field(description="The programming language used by the test file")
    testing_framework: str = Field(description="The testing framework needed to run the tests in the test file")
    number_of_tests: int = Field(description="The number of tests in the test file")
    test_headers_indentation: int = Field(description="The indentation of the test headers in the test file.For example, "def test_..." has an indentation of 0, "  def test_..." has an indentation of 2, "    def test_..." has an indentation of 4, and so on.")

Example output:

You are a code assistant that accepts a python test file as input.
Your goal is to analyze this file and provide the following: 
* The programming language of the test file
* The testing framework needed to run the tests in the test file
* The number of tests in the test file
* The line number in the test file where the new test should be inserted. 

IMPORTANT: Ensure that you account for block delimiters (e.g., curly braces in Java, `end` in Ruby) to correctly place the new test before the end of the relevant block, such as a class or method definition. If a test should live within a class then the insertion happens BEFORE the last delimiter (if relevant).

user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

### Test Framework
The test framework used for running tests is `pytest`.
If the current tests are part of a class and contain a 'self' input, than the generated tests should also include the `self` parameter in the test function signature.


## Additional Instructions
======
However, do not assert exception messages or any string-based messages in assertions, as these may lead to test failures due to minor variations.
======



## Code Coverage
Based on the code coverage report below, your goal is to suggest new test cases for the test file `test_app.py` against the source file `app.py` that would increase the coverage, meaning cover missing lines of code.
=========
Lines covered: [1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 51, 52, 54, 55, 56, 58, 59, 60, 62, 70, 71, 72, 73, 76, 79, 80, 82, 85, 86, 89, 90, 91, 92, 95, 98, 99, 100, 101, 103, 104, 107, 108, 109, 111, 112, 114, 115, 117, 119, 122, 124, 129, 131, 132, 133, 134, 136, 140, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 154, 156, 157, 159]

user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `app.py`.
Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the code coverage report.

user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `app.py`.
Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the code coverage report.
Those numbers are not a part of the original code.

The test framework used for running tests is `pytest`.
If the current tests are part of a class and contain a 'self' input, than the generated tests should also include the `self` parameter in the test function signature.

### Test Framework
The test framework used for running tests is `pytest`.
If the current tests are part of a class and contain a 'self' input, than the generated tests should also include the `self` parameter in the test function signature.

## Additional Instructions
======
However, do not assert exception messages or any string-based messages in assertions, as these may lead to test failures due to minor variations.
======



## Code Coverage
Based on the code coverage report below, your goal is to suggest new test cases for the test file `test_app.py` against the source file `app.py` that would increase the coverage, meaning cover missing lines of code.
=========

user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `app.py`.

### Test Framework
The test framework used for running tests is `pytest`.
If the current tests are part of a class and contain a 'self' input, than the generated tests should also include the `self` parameter in the test function signature.

## Additional Instructions
======
However, do not assert exception messages or any string-based messages in assertions, as these may lead to test failures due to minor variations.
======



## Code Coverage
Based on the code coverage report below, your goal is to suggest new test cases for the test file `test_app.py` against the source file `app.py` that would increase the coverage, meaning cover missing lines of code.
=========

user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `app.py`.

### Test Framework
The test framework used for running tests is `pytest`.
If the current tests are part of a class and contain a 'self' input, than the generated tests should also include the `self` parameter in the test function signature.

## Additional Instructions
======
However, do not assert exception messages or any string-based messages in assertions, as these may lead to test failures due to minor variations.
======



## Code Coverage
Based on the code coverage report below, your goal is to suggest new test cases for the test file `test_app.py` against the source file `app.py` that would increase the coverage, meaning cover missing lines of code.
=========

user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `app.py`.

### Test Framework
The test framework used for running tests is `pytest`.
If the current tests are part of a class and contain a 'self' input, than the generated tests should also include the `self` parameter in the test function signature.


## Previous Iterations Failed Tests
Below is a list of failed tests that were generated in previous iterations. Do not generate the same tests again, and take the failed tests into account when generating new tests.

## Additional Instructions
======
However, do not assert exception messages or any string-based messages in assertions, as these may lead to test failures due to minor variations.
======



## Code Coverage
Based on the code coverage report below, your goal is to suggest new test cases for the test file `test_app.py` against the source file `app.py` that would increase the coverage, meaning cover missing lines of code.
=========
Lines covered: [1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 51, 52, 54, 55, 56, 58, 59, 60, 62, 70, 71, 72, 73, 76, 79, 80, 82, 85, 86, 89, 90, 91, 92, 95, 98, 99, 100, 101, 103, 104, 107, 108, 109, 111, 112, 114, 115, 117, 119, 122, 124, 129, 131, 132, 133, 134, 136, 140, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 156, 157, 159]

    lines_to_cover: str = Field(description="A list of line numbers, currently uncovered, that this specific new test aims to cover")
    test_name: str = Field(description=" A short test name, in snake case, that reflects the behaviour to test")
    test_code: str = Field(description="A new 'pytest' test function that extends the existing test suite, and tests the behavior described in 'test_behavior'. The test should be a written like its a part of the existing test suite, if there is one, and it can use existing helper functions, setup, or teardown code. Don't iclude new imports here, use 'new_imports_code' section instead.")
    new_imports_code: str = Field(description="New imports that are required to run the new test function, and are not already imported in the test file. Give an empty string if no new imports are required. If relevant, add new imports as  'import ...' lines.")
    test_tags: str = Field(description="A single label that best describes the test, out of: ['happy path', 'edge case','other']")

class NewTests(BaseModel):
    language: str = Field(description="The programming language of the source code")
