Now, you need to analyze the test file and provide a YAML object equivalent to type $TestsAnalysis, according to the following Pydantic definitions:
=====

class TestsAnalysis(BaseModel):
    language: str = Field(description="The programming language used by the test file")
    testing_framework: str = Field(description="The testing framework needed to run the tests in the test file")
    number_of_tests: int = Field(description="The number of tests in the test file")
    test_headers_indentation: int = Field(description="The indentation of the test headers in the test file.For example, "def test_..." has an indentation of 0, "  def test_..." has an indentation of 2, "    def test_..." has an indentation of 4, and so on.")

=====


Example output:

```yaml

The Response should be only a valid YAML object, without any introduction text or follow-up text.

You are a code assistant that accepts a python test file as input.
Your goal is to analyze this file and provide the following: 
* The programming language of the test file
* The testing framework needed to run the tests in the test file
* The number of tests in the test file
* The line number in the test file where the new test should be inserted. 

IMPORTANT: Ensure that you account for block delimiters (e.g., curly braces in Java, `end` in Ruby) to correctly place the new test before the end of the relevant block, such as a class or method definition. If a test should live within a class then the insertion happens BEFORE the last delimiter (if relevant).

Here is the file that contains the existing tests, called `test_app.py`. Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the structure of the file. Those numbers are not a part of the original code.

user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `app.py`.
Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the code coverage report.
Those numbers are not a part of the original code.

### Test Framework
The test framework used for running tests is `pytest`.
If the current tests are part of a class and contain a 'self' input, than the generated tests should also include the `self` parameter in the test function signature.


## Additional Instructions
======
However, do not assert exception messages or any string-based messages in assertions, as these may lead to test failures due to minor variations.
======



## Code Coverage
Based on the code coverage report below, your goal is to suggest new test cases for the test file `test_app.py` against the source file `app.py` that would increase the coverage, meaning cover missing lines of code.
=========
Lines covered: [7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 22, 24, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 38, 40, 41, 42, 44, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 61, 62, 64, 71, 72, 73, 75, 76, 79, 80, 81, 83, 84, 86, 87, 88, 89, 91, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 109, 110, 112, 117, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 127, 129, 130, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 141, 142, 143, 145, 153, 158, 169]

Short and concise analysis of why the test run failed, and and recommended Fixes (dont add any other information):

system: 
user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `app.py`.
Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the code coverage report.
Those numbers are not a part of the original code.

### Test Framework
The test framework used for running tests is `pytest`.
If the current tests are part of a class and contain a 'self' input, than the generated tests should also include the `self` parameter in the test function signature.


## Previous Iterations Failed Tests
Below is a list of failed tests that were generated in previous iterations. Do not generate the same tests again, and take the failed tests into account when generating new tests.

```
Test execution error analysis:
The test `test_empty_grid` failed due to an `IndexError: list index out of range` when trying to access `self.grid[current.x][current.y]` in the `plan` method of the `AStar` class. This occurs because the grid is empty (`grid = []`), and thus any attempt to access an index will result in an out-of-bounds error.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Handle Empty Grid Case**: Modify the `plan` method in the `AStar` class to check if the grid is empty before proceeding with the pathfinding logic. If the grid is empty, immediately return `(False, [])`.
   
   Example modification:
   ```python
   if self.n == 0:
       return False, []
   ```

2. **Update Test Logic**: Ensure that the test case `test_empty_grid` accurately reflects the expected behavior when an empty grid is provided, which should be handled gracefully by the algorithm.

## Additional Instructions
======
However, do not assert exception messages or any string-based messages in assertions, as these may lead to test failures due to minor variations.
======



## Code Coverage
Based on the code coverage report below, your goal is to suggest new test cases for the test file `test_app.py` against the source file `app.py` that would increase the coverage, meaning cover missing lines of code.
=========
Lines covered: [7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 22, 24, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 38, 40, 41, 42, 44, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 61, 62, 64, 71, 72, 73, 75, 76, 79, 80, 81, 83, 84, 86, 87, 88, 89, 91, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 109, 110, 112, 117, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 127, 129, 130, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 141, 142, 143, 145, 153, 158, 169]

Short and concise analysis of why the test run failed, and and recommended Fixes (dont add any other information):

system: 
user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `app.py`.
Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the code coverage report.
Those numbers are not a part of the original code.

Test execution error analysis:
The test `test_empty_grid` failed due to an `IndexError: list index out of range` when trying to access `self.grid[current.x][current.y]` in the `plan` method of the `AStar` class. This occurs because the grid is empty (`grid = []`), and thus any attempt to access an index will result in an out-of-bounds error.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Handle Empty Grid Case**: Modify the `plan` method in the `AStar` class to check if the grid is empty before proceeding with the pathfinding logic. If the grid is empty, immediately return `(False, [])`.
   
   Example modification:
   ```python
   if self.n == 0:
       return False, []
   ```

2. **Update Test Logic**: Ensure that the test case `test_empty_grid` accurately reflects the expected behavior when an empty grid is provided, which should be handled gracefully by the algorithm.

```
Test execution error analysis:
The test `test_empty_grid` failed due to an `IndexError: list index out of range`. This occurs because the `AStar` class is attempting to access elements in the `grid` using coordinates from the `start` and `goal` nodes, which are initialized to `(0, 0)`. However, since the `grid` is empty (`grid = []`), there are no valid indices to access, leading to the error.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Modify the `test_empty_grid` test case**: Before calling `astar.plan(start, goal)`, check if the grid is empty and handle this case appropriately. You can either skip the test or assert that the expected output is `(False, [])`.

2. **Update the `plan` method in the `AStar` class**: Add a check at the beginning of the `plan` method to return `(False, [])` if the grid is empty. This will prevent the method from attempting to access indices in an empty list. 

Example modification in `plan` method:
```python
if not self.grid or not self.grid[0]:  # Check if grid is empty
    return False, []
```

```
Test execution error analysis:
The test `test_goal_unreachable` failed because the A* algorithm incorrectly identified that a path exists to the goal node (1, 1), which is blocked by obstacles. The assertion expected `found` to be `False`, but it was `True`, indicating that the algorithm did not properly account for the obstacles in the grid.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Review the A* Algorithm Logic**: Ensure that the algorithm correctly checks for obstacles and does not add blocked nodes to the open list.
2. **Check the `plan` Method**: Specifically, verify the conditions under which nodes are added to the open list and ensure that blocked nodes are skipped.
3. **Test with Additional Scenarios**: Add more test cases with various configurations of obstacles to ensure robustness against similar issues.

Short and concise analysis of why the test run failed, and and recommended Fixes (dont add any other information):

system: 
user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `app.py`.
Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the code coverage report.
Those numbers are not a part of the original code.

The test framework used for running tests is `pytest`.
If the current tests are part of a class and contain a 'self' input, than the generated tests should also include the `self` parameter in the test function signature.

```
Test execution error analysis:
The test `test_empty_grid` failed due to an `IndexError: list index out of range` when trying to access `self.grid[current.x][current.y]` in the `plan` method of the `AStar` class. This occurs because the grid is empty (`grid = []`), and thus any attempt to access an index will result in an out-of-bounds error.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Handle Empty Grid Case**: Modify the `plan` method in the `AStar` class to check if the grid is empty before proceeding with the pathfinding logic. If the grid is empty, immediately return `(False, [])`.
   
   Example modification:
   ```python
   if self.n == 0:
       return False, []
   ```

2. **Update Test Logic**: Ensure that the test case `test_empty_grid` accurately reflects the expected behavior when an empty grid is provided, which should be handled gracefully by the algorithm.

```
Test execution error analysis:
The test `test_empty_grid` failed due to an `IndexError: list index out of range`. This occurs because the `AStar` class is attempting to access elements in the `grid` using coordinates from the `start` and `goal` nodes, which are initialized to `(0, 0)`. However, since the `grid` is empty (`grid = []`), there are no valid indices to access, leading to the error.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Modify the `test_empty_grid` test case**: Before calling `astar.plan(start, goal)`, check if the grid is empty and handle this case appropriately. You can either skip the test or assert that the expected output is `(False, [])`.

2. **Update the `plan` method in the `AStar` class**: Add a check at the beginning of the `plan` method to return `(False, [])` if the grid is empty. This will prevent the method from attempting to access indices in an empty list. 

Example modification in `plan` method:
```python
if not self.grid or not self.grid[0]:  # Check if grid is empty
    return False, []
```

The test `test_goal_unreachable` failed because the A* algorithm incorrectly identified that a path exists to the goal node (1, 1), which is blocked by obstacles. The assertion expected `found` to be `False`, but it was `True`, indicating that the algorithm did not properly account for the obstacles in the grid.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Review the A* Algorithm Logic**: Ensure that the algorithm correctly checks for obstacles and does not add blocked nodes to the open list.
2. **Check the `plan` Method**: Specifically, verify the conditions under which nodes are added to the open list and ensure that blocked nodes are skipped.
3. **Test with Additional Scenarios**: Add more test cases with various configurations of obstacles to ensure robustness against similar issues.

Test execution error analysis:
The test run failed due to an `IndexError: list index out of range` in the `test_empty_grid` function.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Handle Empty Grid Case**: Modify the `plan` method in the `AStar` class to check if the grid is empty before proceeding with the pathfinding logic. If the grid is empty, immediately return `(False, [])`.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Review the Pathfinding Logic**: Ensure that the A* algorithm correctly identifies and handles obstacles in the grid. Specifically, check the conditions under which nodes are added to the open list and ensure that nodes representing obstacles are not considered valid paths.

2. **Test the Goal Node's Accessibility**: Add checks in the `plan` method to verify that the goal node is not surrounded by obstacles before attempting to find a path.

3. **Debugging Output**: Consider adding debugging statements to log the state of the open and closed lists during execution to better understand how the algorithm is processing nodes.

## Response
The output must be a YAML object equivalent to type $NewTests, according to the following Pydantic definitions:
=====
class SingleTest(BaseModel):
    test_behavior: str = Field(description="Short description of the behavior the test covers")
    lines_to_cover: str = Field(description="A list of line numbers, currently uncovered, that this specific new test aims to cover")
    test_name: str = Field(description=" A short test name, in snake case, that reflects the behaviour to test")
    test_code: str = Field(description="A new 'pytest' test function that extends the existing test suite, and tests the behavior described in 'test_behavior'. The test should be a written like its a part of the existing test suite, if there is one, and it can use existing helper functions, setup, or teardown code. Don't iclude new imports here, use 'new_imports_code' section instead.")
    new_imports_code: str = Field(description="New imports that are required to run the new test function, and are not already imported in the test file. Give an empty string if no new imports are required. If relevant, add new imports as  'import ...' lines.")
    test_tags: str = Field(description="A single label that best describes the test, out of: ['happy path', 'edge case','other']")

class NewTests(BaseModel):
    language: str = Field(description="The programming language of the source code")
    existing_test_function_signature: str = Field(description="A single line repeating a signature header of one of the existing test functions")
    new_tests: List[SingleTest] = Field(min_items=1, max_items=4, description="A list of new test functions to append to the existing test suite, aiming to increase the code coverage. Each test should run as-is, without requiring any additional inputs or setup code. Don't introduce new dependencies")

user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `app.py`.
Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the code coverage report.
Those numbers are not a part of the original code.

```
Test execution error analysis:
The test `test_empty_grid` failed due to an `IndexError: list index out of range` when trying to access `self.grid[current.x][current.y]` in the `plan` method of the `AStar` class. This occurs because the grid is empty (`grid = []`), and thus any attempt to access an index will result in an out-of-bounds error.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Handle Empty Grid Case**: Modify the `plan` method in the `AStar` class to check if the grid is empty before proceeding with the pathfinding logic. If the grid is empty, immediately return `(False, [])`.
   
   Example modification:
   ```python
   if self.n == 0:
       return False, []
   ```

2. **Update Test Logic**: Ensure that the test case `test_empty_grid` accurately reflects the expected behavior when an empty grid is provided, which should be handled gracefully by the algorithm.

```
Test execution error analysis:
The test `test_empty_grid` failed due to an `IndexError: list index out of range`. This occurs because the `AStar` class is attempting to access elements in the `grid` using coordinates from the `start` and `goal` nodes, which are initialized to `(0, 0)`. However, since the `grid` is empty (`grid = []`), there are no valid indices to access, leading to the error.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Modify the `test_empty_grid` test case**: Before calling `astar.plan(start, goal)`, check if the grid is empty and handle this case appropriately. You can either skip the test or assert that the expected output is `(False, [])`.

2. **Update the `plan` method in the `AStar` class**: Add a check at the beginning of the `plan` method to return `(False, [])` if the grid is empty. This will prevent the method from attempting to access indices in an empty list. 

Example modification in `plan` method:
```python
if not self.grid or not self.grid[0]:  # Check if grid is empty
    return False, []
```

```
Test execution error analysis:
The test `test_goal_unreachable` failed because the A* algorithm incorrectly identified that a path exists to the goal node (1, 1), which is blocked by obstacles. The assertion expected `found` to be `False`, but it was `True`, indicating that the algorithm did not properly account for the obstacles in the grid.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Review the A* Algorithm Logic**: Ensure that the algorithm correctly checks for obstacles and does not add blocked nodes to the open list.
2. **Check the `plan` Method**: Specifically, verify the conditions under which nodes are added to the open list and ensure that blocked nodes are skipped.
3. **Test with Additional Scenarios**: Add more test cases with various configurations of obstacles to ensure robustness against similar issues.

```
Test execution error analysis:
The test run failed due to an `IndexError: list index out of range` in the `test_empty_grid` function. This occurs because the `AStar` class's `plan` method attempts to access `self.grid[current.x][current.y]` when `current.x` and `current.y` are both `0`, but the grid is empty (`grid = []`), leading to an invalid index access.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Handle Empty Grid Case**: Modify the `plan` method in the `AStar` class to check if the grid is empty before proceeding with the pathfinding logic. If the grid is empty, immediately return `(False, [])`.

   Example modification:
   ```python
   def plan(self, start: Node, goal: Node) -> Tuple[bool, List[Node]]:
       if self.n == 0:  # Check if the grid is empty
           return False, []
   ```

2. **Update Test Logic**: Ensure that the test case `test_empty_grid` accurately reflects the expected behavior when the grid is empty.

The assertion expected `found` to be `False`, but it was `True`, indicating that the algorithm did not properly account for the obstacles when determining the path.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Review the Pathfinding Logic**: Ensure that the A* algorithm correctly identifies and handles obstacles in the grid. Specifically, check the conditions under which nodes are added to the open list and ensure that nodes representing obstacles are not considered valid paths.

2. **Test the Goal Node's Accessibility**: Add checks in the `plan` method to verify that the goal node is not surrounded by obstacles before attempting to find a path.

3. **Debugging Output**: Consider adding debugging statements to log the state of the open and closed lists during execution to better understand how the algorithm is processing nodes.

Since there are no rows in the grid, trying to access any index results in an out-of-bounds error.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Add a Check for Empty Grid**: Modify the `plan` method in the `AStar` class to check if the grid is empty before proceeding with the pathfinding logic. If the grid is empty, return `(False, [])` immediately.

Short and concise analysis of why the test run failed, and and recommended Fixes (dont add any other information):

system: 
user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `app.py`.
Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the code coverage report.
Those numbers are not a part of the original code.

### Test Framework
The test framework used for running tests is `pytest`.
If the current tests are part of a class and contain a 'self' input, than the generated tests should also include the `self` parameter in the test function signature.

```
Test execution error analysis:
The test `test_empty_grid` failed due to an `IndexError: list index out of range` when trying to access `self.grid[current.x][current.y]` in the `plan` method of the `AStar` class. This occurs because the grid is empty (`grid = []`), and thus any attempt to access an index will result in an out-of-bounds error.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Handle Empty Grid Case**: Modify the `plan` method in the `AStar` class to check if the grid is empty before proceeding with the pathfinding logic. If the grid is empty, immediately return `(False, [])`.
   
   Example modification:
   ```python
   if self.n == 0:
       return False, []
   ```

2. **Update Test Logic**: Ensure that the test case `test_empty_grid` accurately reflects the expected behavior when an empty grid is provided, which should be handled gracefully by the algorithm.

```
Test execution error analysis:
The test `test_empty_grid` failed due to an `IndexError: list index out of range`. This occurs because the `AStar` class is attempting to access elements in the `grid` using coordinates from the `start` and `goal` nodes, which are initialized to `(0, 0)`. However, since the `grid` is empty (`grid = []`), there are no valid indices to access, leading to the error.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Modify the `test_empty_grid` test case**: Before calling `astar.plan(start, goal)`, check if the grid is empty and handle this case appropriately. You can either skip the test or assert that the expected output is `(False, [])`.

2. **Update the `plan` method in the `AStar` class**: Add a check at the beginning of the `plan` method to return `(False, [])` if the grid is empty. This will prevent the method from attempting to access indices in an empty list. 

Example modification in `plan` method:
```python
if not self.grid or not self.grid[0]:  # Check if grid is empty
    return False, []
```

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Review the A* Algorithm Logic**: Ensure that the algorithm correctly checks for obstacles and does not add blocked nodes to the open list.
2. **Check the `plan` Method**: Specifically, verify the conditions under which nodes are added to the open list and ensure that blocked nodes are skipped.
3. **Test with Additional Scenarios**: Add more test cases with various configurations of obstacles to ensure robustness against similar issues.

### Recommended Fixes:

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Review the Pathfinding Logic**: Ensure that the A* algorithm correctly identifies and handles obstacles in the grid. Specifically, check the conditions under which nodes are added to the open list and ensure that nodes representing obstacles are not considered valid paths.

2. **Test the Goal Node's Accessibility**: Add checks in the `plan` method to verify that the goal node is not surrounded by obstacles before attempting to find a path.

3. **Debugging Output**: Consider adding debugging statements to log the state of the open and closed lists during execution to better understand how the algorithm is processing nodes.

Since there are no rows in the grid, trying to access any index results in an out-of-bounds error.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Add a Check for Empty Grid**: Modify the `plan` method in the `AStar` class to check if the grid is empty before proceeding with the pathfinding logic. If the grid is empty, return `(False, [])` immediately.

   ```python

       # Existing logic follows...

2. **Adjust Test Case**: Ensure that the test case `test_empty_grid` correctly reflects the expected behavior when the grid is empty. The test should expect a return of `(False, [])` without causing an error.

The test `test_empty_grid` failed due to an `IndexError: list index out of range`. This occurs because the `AStar` class's `plan` method attempts to access `self.grid[current.x][current.y]` when the grid is empty (i.e., `self.n` is 0). Since `current.x` and `current.y` are both 0, this results in an attempt to access an index that does not exist.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Add a Check for Empty Grid**: Modify the `plan` method in the `AStar` class to check if the grid is empty before proceeding with the pathfinding logic. If the grid is empty, immediately return `(False, [])`.

   ```python
   def plan(self, start: Node, goal: Node) -> Tuple[bool, List[Node]]:
       if self.n == 0:
           return False, []
   ```

2. **Ensure Valid Start and Goal Nodes**: Before adding the start node to the open list, check that its coordinates are within the bounds of the grid.

Implementing these changes should resolve the test failure.

```
Test execution error analysis:
The test `test_goal_unreachable` failed because the A* algorithm incorrectly identified that a path exists to the goal node (1, 1), which is blocked by obstacles. The assertion expected `found` to be `False`, but it was `True`.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Check Pathfinding Logic**: Review the `plan` method in the AStar class to ensure that it correctly identifies when a goal is unreachable due to obstacles.
2. **Update Node Handling**: Ensure that nodes that are blocked by obstacles are not added to the open list, and that the algorithm properly terminates when no valid moves are available.
3. **Test Edge Cases**: Add additional tests to cover scenarios where the start or goal is adjacent to obstacles to ensure robustness.

Test execution error analysis:
The test `test_obstacles_around_goal` failed because the A* algorithm incorrectly found a path to the goal node (1, 1), which is surrounded by obstacles. The assertion expected that no path should be found, but the algorithm returned `found` as `True`.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Check Obstacle Handling**: Review the logic in the `plan` method of the `AStar` class to ensure that it correctly identifies when a node is surrounded by obstacles and does not allow it to be added to the open list.
2. **Update Node Evaluation**: Ensure that the algorithm properly evaluates the neighbors of the current node and correctly marks nodes as blocked if they are obstacles.
3. **Test Edge Cases**: Add additional test cases to cover scenarios where the goal is surrounded by obstacles to ensure robustness.

user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `app.py`.
Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the code coverage report.
Those numbers are not a part of the original code.

Test execution error analysis:
The test `test_empty_grid` failed due to an `IndexError: list index out of range` when trying to access `self.grid[current.x][current.y]` in the `plan` method of the `AStar` class. This occurs because the grid is empty (`grid = []`), and thus any attempt to access an index will result in an out-of-bounds error.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Handle Empty Grid Case**: Modify the `plan` method in the `AStar` class to check if the grid is empty before proceeding with the pathfinding logic. If the grid is empty, immediately return `(False, [])`.
   
   Example modification:
   ```python
   if self.n == 0:
       return False, []
   ```

2. **Update Test Logic**: Ensure that the test case `test_empty_grid` accurately reflects the expected behavior when an empty grid is provided, which should be handled gracefully by the algorithm.

Test execution error analysis:
The test `test_empty_grid` failed due to an `IndexError: list index out of range`. This occurs because the `AStar` class is attempting to access elements in the `grid` using coordinates from the `start` and `goal` nodes, which are initialized to `(0, 0)`. However, since the `grid` is empty (`grid = []`), there are no valid indices to access, leading to the error.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Modify the `test_empty_grid` test case**: Before calling `astar.plan(start, goal)`, check if the grid is empty and handle this case appropriately. You can either skip the test or assert that the expected output is `(False, [])`.

2. **Update the `plan` method in the `AStar` class**: Add a check at the beginning of the `plan` method to return `(False, [])` if the grid is empty. This will prevent the method from attempting to access indices in an empty list. 

Example modification in `plan` method:
```python
if not self.grid or not self.grid[0]:  # Check if grid is empty
    return False, []
```

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Review the A* Algorithm Logic**: Ensure that the algorithm correctly checks for obstacles and does not add blocked nodes to the open list.
2. **Check the `plan` Method**: Specifically, verify the conditions under which nodes are added to the open list and ensure that blocked nodes are skipped.
3. **Test with Additional Scenarios**: Add more test cases with various configurations of obstacles to ensure robustness against similar issues.

2. **Test the Goal Node's Accessibility**: Add checks in the `plan` method to verify that the goal node is not surrounded by obstacles before attempting to find a path.

3. **Debugging Output**: Consider adding debugging statements to log the state of the open and closed lists during execution to better understand how the algorithm is processing nodes.

```
Test execution error analysis:
The test `test_obstacles_around_goal` failed because the A* algorithm incorrectly identified a path to the goal node (1, 1), which is surrounded by obstacles. The assertion `assert found is False` expected no path to be found, but the algorithm returned `found` as `True`.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Review the A* Algorithm Logic**: Ensure that the algorithm correctly identifies when a goal is unreachable due to surrounding obstacles. Specifically, check the conditions under which nodes are added to the open list and ensure that obstacles are properly accounted for.

2. **Update the Test Case**: If the algorithm is functioning as intended, verify the test case's expectations. The goal node (1, 1) should indeed be unreachable in the given grid configuration.

3. **Add Debugging Statements**: Temporarily add print statements in the `plan` method to trace the nodes being evaluated and the decisions made regarding obstacles to better understand why the path was incorrectly found.

## Additional Instructions
======
However, do not assert exception messages or any string-based messages in assertions, as these may lead to test failures due to minor variations.
