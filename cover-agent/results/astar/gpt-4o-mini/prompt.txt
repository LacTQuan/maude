Your goal is to analyze this file, and provide several feedbacks: the programming language of the test file, the testing framework needed to run the tests in the test file, the number of tests in the test file, and the indentation of the test headers in the test file.

Here is the file that contains the existing tests, called `test_app.py`:

* The number of tests in the test file
* The line number in the test file where the new test should be inserted. 

IMPORTANT: Ensure that you account for block delimiters (e.g., curly braces in Java, `end` in Ruby) to correctly place the new test before the end of the relevant block, such as a class or method definition. If a test should live within a class then the insertion happens BEFORE the last delimiter (if relevant).

You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `app.py`.
Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the code coverage report.
Those numbers are not a part of the original code.

### Test Framework
The test framework used for running tests is `pytest`.
If the current tests are part of a class and contain a 'self' input, than the generated tests should also include the `self` parameter in the test function signature.


## Code Coverage
Based on the code coverage report below, your goal is to suggest new test cases for the test file `test_app.py` against the source file `app.py` that would increase the coverage, meaning cover missing lines of code.
=========
Lines covered: [7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 22, 24, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 38, 40, 41, 42, 44, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 61, 62, 64, 71, 72, 73, 75, 76, 79, 80, 81, 83, 86, 87, 88, 89, 91, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 109, 110, 112, 117, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 127, 129, 130, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 141, 142, 143, 145, 153, 158, 169]

user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `app.py`.
Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the code coverage report.
Those numbers are not a part of the original code.

The test framework used for running tests is `pytest`.
If the current tests are part of a class and contain a 'self' input, than the generated tests should also include the `self` parameter in the test function signature.

```
Test execution error analysis:
The test `test_adjacent_start_goal_blocked` failed because the A* algorithm incorrectly found a path between the start node `(0, 0)` and the goal node `(0, 1)`, despite the goal being adjacent to an obstacle. The assertion expected `found` to be `False`, indicating no path should exist, but it returned `True`.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Check Obstacle Handling**: Ensure that the algorithm correctly identifies when the goal node is adjacent to an obstacle and prevents it from being reachable.
2. **Update Pathfinding Logic**: Modify the `plan` method in the `AStar` class to include checks for adjacent obstacles when determining if a path can be found.
3. **Test Edge Cases**: Add additional tests to cover scenarios where the start and goal are adjacent to obstacles to ensure robustness.

Short and concise analysis of why the test run failed, and and recommended Fixes (dont add any other information):

system: 
user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `app.py`.
Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the code coverage report.
Those numbers are not a part of the original code.

### Test Framework
The test framework used for running tests is `pytest`.
If the current tests are part of a class and contain a 'self' input, than the generated tests should also include the `self` parameter in the test function signature.

```
Test execution error analysis:
The test `test_adjacent_start_goal_blocked` failed because the A* algorithm incorrectly found a path between the start node `(0, 0)` and the goal node `(0, 1)`, despite the goal being adjacent to an obstacle. The assertion expected `found` to be `False`, indicating no path should exist, but it returned `True`.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Check Obstacle Handling**: Ensure that the algorithm correctly identifies when the goal node is adjacent to an obstacle and prevents it from being reachable.
2. **Update Pathfinding Logic**: Modify the `plan` method in the `AStar` class to include checks for adjacent obstacles when determining if a path can be found.
3. **Test Edge Cases**: Add additional tests to cover scenarios where the start and goal are adjacent to obstacles to ensure robustness.

Test execution error analysis:
The test `test_goal_unreachable_due_to_obstacles` failed because the A* algorithm incorrectly reported that a path was found (returned `found` as `True`) when the goal was unreachable due to obstacles. The assertion expected `found` to be `False`.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Check Pathfinding Logic**: Review the `plan` method in the `AStar` class to ensure that it correctly identifies when the goal is unreachable due to obstacles. Specifically, verify the conditions under which nodes are added to the `open_list` and ensure that the algorithm properly handles scenarios where the goal cannot be reached.

2. **Debugging Output**: Add debugging statements to log the state of the `open_list`, `closed_list`, and the current node being processed to trace the pathfinding logic during execution.

3. **Test Case Validation**: Ensure that the grid setup in the test accurately reflects the intended scenario, where the goal is indeed unreachable due to obstacles.

Short and concise analysis of why the test run failed, and and recommended Fixes (dont add any other information):

system: 
user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `app.py`.
Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the code coverage report.

The test framework used for running tests is `pytest`.
If the current tests are part of a class and contain a 'self' input, than the generated tests should also include the `self` parameter in the test function signature.

```
Test execution error analysis:
The test `test_adjacent_start_goal_blocked` failed because the A* algorithm incorrectly found a path between the start node `(0, 0)` and the goal node `(0, 1)`, despite the goal being adjacent to an obstacle. The assertion expected `found` to be `False`, indicating no path should exist, but it returned `True`.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Check Obstacle Handling**: Ensure that the algorithm correctly identifies when the goal node is adjacent to an obstacle and prevents it from being reachable.
2. **Update Pathfinding Logic**: Modify the `plan` method in the `AStar` class to include checks for adjacent obstacles when determining if a path can be found.
3. **Test Edge Cases**: Add additional tests to cover scenarios where the start and goal are adjacent to obstacles to ensure robustness.

Test execution error analysis:
The test `test_goal_unreachable_due_to_obstacles` failed because the A* algorithm incorrectly reported that a path was found (returned `found` as `True`) when the goal was unreachable due to obstacles. The assertion expected `found` to be `False`.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Check Pathfinding Logic**: Review the `plan` method in the `AStar` class to ensure that it correctly identifies when the goal is unreachable due to obstacles. Specifically, verify the conditions under which nodes are added to the `open_list` and ensure that the algorithm properly handles scenarios where the goal cannot be reached.

2. **Debugging Output**: Add debugging statements to log the state of the `open_list`, `closed_list`, and the current node being processed to trace the pathfinding logic during execution.

3. **Test Case Validation**: Ensure that the grid setup in the test accurately reflects the intended scenario, where the goal is indeed unreachable due to obstacles.

```
Test execution error analysis:
The test run failed due to an error in the `test_goal_unreachable_due_to_obstacles_filled` test case. The error message indicates that the fixture 'self' was not found, which suggests that the test function is incorrectly defined or is missing the necessary context for pytest to recognize it as a valid test.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Check Test Function Definition**: Ensure that the test function `test_goal_unreachable_due_to_obstacles_filled` is defined correctly. It should not have any parameters unless they are valid pytest fixtures.

2. **Remove Unnecessary Parameters**: If the function is meant to be a standalone test without any fixtures, remove any parameters that are not needed.

3. **Review Class Structure**: If the test is intended to be part of a class, ensure that the class is properly defined and that pytest is aware of it.

4. **Run Tests Individually**: To isolate the issue, try running the failing test individually using `pytest test_app.py::test_goal_unreachable_due_to_obstacles_filled` to see if the error persists. 

By addressing these points, the test should be able to run successfully.

```
Test execution error analysis:
The test run failed due to an error in the `test_start_surrounded_by_obstacles_filled` function, specifically because it attempted to use a fixture named `self`, which is not defined in the context of pytest. This resulted in the error message indicating that the fixture 'self' was not found.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Remove or Correct the Use of `self`:** Ensure that the test function does not reference `self` unless it is part of a class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. If the test is meant to be a standalone function, remove any references to `self`.

2. **Check for Class-Based Structure:** If you intended to use class-based tests, define the test functions within a class that inherits from `pytest` or `unittest.TestCase`.

3. **Run Tests Individually:** If the issue persists, try running the tests individually to isolate the problem further.

By addressing the fixture issue, the test should run successfully.

Short and concise analysis of why the test run failed, and and recommended Fixes (dont add any other information):

system: 
user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.

### Test Framework
The test framework used for running tests is `pytest`.
If the current tests are part of a class and contain a 'self' input, than the generated tests should also include the `self` parameter in the test function signature.

```
Test execution error analysis:
The test `test_adjacent_start_goal_blocked` failed because the A* algorithm incorrectly found a path between the start node `(0, 0)` and the goal node `(0, 1)`, despite the goal being adjacent to an obstacle. The assertion expected `found` to be `False`, indicating no path should exist, but it returned `True`.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Check Obstacle Handling**: Ensure that the algorithm correctly identifies when the goal node is adjacent to an obstacle and prevents it from being reachable.
2. **Update Pathfinding Logic**: Modify the `plan` method in the `AStar` class to include checks for adjacent obstacles when determining if a path can be found.
3. **Test Edge Cases**: Add additional tests to cover scenarios where the start and goal are adjacent to obstacles to ensure robustness.

Test execution error analysis:
The test `test_goal_unreachable_due_to_obstacles` failed because the A* algorithm incorrectly reported that a path was found (returned `found` as `True`) when the goal was unreachable due to obstacles. The assertion expected `found` to be `False`.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Check Pathfinding Logic**: Review the `plan` method in the `AStar` class to ensure that it correctly identifies when the goal is unreachable due to obstacles. Specifically, verify the conditions under which nodes are added to the `open_list` and ensure that the algorithm properly handles scenarios where the goal cannot be reached.

2. **Debugging Output**: Add debugging statements to log the state of the `open_list`, `closed_list`, and the current node being processed to trace the pathfinding logic during execution.

3. **Test Case Validation**: Ensure that the grid setup in the test accurately reflects the intended scenario, where the goal is indeed unreachable due to obstacles.

```
Test execution error analysis:
The test run failed due to an error in the `test_goal_unreachable_due_to_obstacles_filled` test case. The error message indicates that the fixture 'self' was not found, which suggests that the test function is incorrectly defined or is missing the necessary context for pytest to recognize it as a valid test.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Check Test Function Definition**: Ensure that the test function `test_goal_unreachable_due_to_obstacles_filled` is defined correctly. It should not have any parameters unless they are valid pytest fixtures.

2. **Remove Unnecessary Parameters**: If the function is meant to be a standalone test without any fixtures, remove any parameters that are not needed.

3. **Review Class Structure**: If the test is intended to be part of a class, ensure that the class is properly defined and that pytest is aware of it.

4. **Run Tests Individually**: To isolate the issue, try running the failing test individually using `pytest test_app.py::test_goal_unreachable_due_to_obstacles_filled` to see if the error persists. 

By addressing these points, the test should be able to run successfully.

```
Test execution error analysis:
The test run failed due to an error in the `test_start_surrounded_by_obstacles_filled` function, specifically because it attempted to use a fixture named `self`, which is not defined in the context of pytest. This resulted in the error message indicating that the fixture 'self' was not found.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Remove or Correct the Use of `self`:** Ensure that the test function does not reference `self` unless it is part of a class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. If the test is meant to be a standalone function, remove any references to `self`.

2. **Check for Class-Based Structure:** If you intended to use class-based tests, define the test functions within a class that inherits from `pytest` or `unittest.TestCase`.

3. **Run Tests Individually:** If the issue persists, try running the tests individually to isolate the problem further.

By addressing the fixture issue, the test should run successfully.

```
Test execution error analysis:
The test `test_start_goal_opposite_corners_blocked` failed because the A* algorithm incorrectly found a path between the start node (1, 1) and the goal node (3, 3) despite the presence of obstacles blocking the path. The assertion expected `found` to be `False`, indicating no path should be found, but it returned `True`.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Check Pathfinding Logic**: Review the `plan` method in the `AStar` class to ensure that it correctly identifies when a path is blocked by obstacles. Specifically, verify that nodes representing obstacles are properly handled and not added to the open list.

2. **Boundary Conditions**: Ensure that the logic for checking if a node is outside the grid boundaries and if it is an obstacle is functioning correctly. This includes verifying that the grid is being reset properly before each search.

3. **Debugging Output**: Add debugging statements within the `plan` method to log the state of the open and closed lists, as well as the current node being processed, to help trace the pathfinding logic during execution.

4. **Test Coverage**: Consider adding more tests that cover edge cases, such as different configurations of obstacles, to ensure robustness in the pathfinding implementation.

user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `app.py`.
Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the code coverage report.
Those numbers are not a part of the original code.

### Test Framework
The test framework used for running tests is `pytest`.
If the current tests are part of a class and contain a 'self' input, than the generated tests should also include the `self` parameter in the test function signature.

```
Test execution error analysis:
The test `test_adjacent_start_goal_blocked` failed because the A* algorithm incorrectly found a path between the start node `(0, 0)` and the goal node `(0, 1)`, despite the goal being adjacent to an obstacle. The assertion expected `found` to be `False`, indicating no path should exist, but it returned `True`.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Check Obstacle Handling**: Ensure that the algorithm correctly identifies when the goal node is adjacent to an obstacle and prevents it from being reachable.
2. **Update Pathfinding Logic**: Modify the `plan` method in the `AStar` class to include checks for adjacent obstacles when determining if a path can be found.
3. **Test Edge Cases**: Add additional tests to cover scenarios where the start and goal are adjacent to obstacles to ensure robustness.

Test execution error analysis:
The test `test_goal_unreachable_due_to_obstacles` failed because the A* algorithm incorrectly reported that a path was found (returned `found` as `True`) when the goal was unreachable due to obstacles. The assertion expected `found` to be `False`.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Check Pathfinding Logic**: Review the `plan` method in the `AStar` class to ensure that it correctly identifies when the goal is unreachable due to obstacles. Specifically, verify the conditions under which nodes are added to the `open_list` and ensure that the algorithm properly handles scenarios where the goal cannot be reached.

2. **Debugging Output**: Add debugging statements to log the state of the `open_list`, `closed_list`, and the current node being processed to trace the pathfinding logic during execution.

3. **Test Case Validation**: Ensure that the grid setup in the test accurately reflects the intended scenario, where the goal is indeed unreachable due to obstacles.

Test execution error analysis:
The test run failed due to an error in the `test_path_with_obstacles_filled` function. The error message indicates that the fixture 'self' was not found, which suggests that the function is incorrectly defined as an instance method (with `self` as a parameter) instead of a standalone function.

**Recommended Fixes:**
1. Remove the `self` parameter from the `test_path_with_obstacles_filled` function definition. Change:
   ```python
   def test_path_with_obstacles_filled(self):
   ```
   to:
   ```python
   def test_path_with_obstacles_filled():
   ```

```
Test execution error analysis:
The test run failed due to an error in the `test_goal_unreachable_due_to_obstacles_filled` test case. The error message indicates that the fixture 'self' was not found, which suggests that the test function is incorrectly defined or is missing the necessary context for pytest to recognize it as a valid test.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Check Test Function Definition**: Ensure that the test function `test_goal_unreachable_due_to_obstacles_filled` is defined correctly. It should not have any parameters unless they are valid pytest fixtures.

2. **Remove Unnecessary Parameters**: If the function is meant to be a standalone test without any fixtures, remove any parameters that are not needed.

3. **Review Class Structure**: If the test is intended to be part of a class, ensure that the class is properly defined and that pytest is aware of it.

4. **Run Tests Individually**: To isolate the issue, try running the failing test individually using `pytest test_app.py::test_goal_unreachable_due_to_obstacles_filled` to see if the error persists. 

By addressing these points, the test should be able to run successfully.

```
Test execution error analysis:
The test run failed due to an error in the `test_start_surrounded_by_obstacles_filled` function, specifically because it attempted to use a fixture named `self`, which is not defined in the context of pytest. This resulted in the error message indicating that the fixture 'self' was not found.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Remove or Correct the Use of `self`:** Ensure that the test function does not reference `self` unless it is part of a class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. If the test is meant to be a standalone function, remove any references to `self`.

2. **Check for Class-Based Structure:** If you intended to use class-based tests, define the test functions within a class that inherits from `pytest` or `unittest.TestCase`.

3. **Run Tests Individually:** If the issue persists, try running the tests individually to isolate the problem further.

By addressing the fixture issue, the test should run successfully.

```
Test execution error analysis:
The test `test_start_goal_opposite_corners_blocked` failed because the A* algorithm incorrectly found a path between the start node (1, 1) and the goal node (3, 3) despite the presence of obstacles blocking the path. The assertion expected `found` to be `False`, indicating no path should be found, but it returned `True`.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Check Pathfinding Logic**: Review the `plan` method in the `AStar` class to ensure that it correctly identifies when a path is blocked by obstacles. Specifically, verify that nodes representing obstacles are properly handled and not added to the open list.

2. **Boundary Conditions**: Ensure that the logic for checking if a node is outside the grid boundaries and if it is an obstacle is functioning correctly. This includes verifying that the grid is being reset properly before each search.

3. **Debugging Output**: Add debugging statements within the `plan` method to log the state of the open and closed lists, as well as the current node being processed, to help trace the pathfinding logic during execution.

4. **Test Coverage**: Consider adding more tests that cover edge cases, such as different configurations of obstacles, to ensure robustness in the pathfinding implementation.

The test should be a written like its a part of the existing test suite, if there is one, and it can use existing helper functions, setup, or teardown code. Don't iclude new imports here, use 'new_imports_code' section instead.")
    new_imports_code: str = Field(description="New imports that are required to run the new test function, and are not already imported in the test file. Give an empty string if no new imports are required. If relevant, add new imports as  'import ...' lines.")
    test_tags: str = Field(description="A single label that best describes the test, out of: ['happy path', 'edge case','other']")

class NewTests(BaseModel):

Short and concise analysis of why the test run failed, and and recommended Fixes (dont add any other information):

system: 
user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `app.py`.
Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the code coverage report.
Those numbers are not a part of the original code.

### Test Framework
The test framework used for running tests is `pytest`.
If the current tests are part of a class and contain a 'self' input, than the generated tests should also include the `self` parameter in the test function signature.

```
Test execution error analysis:
The test `test_adjacent_start_goal_blocked` failed because the A* algorithm incorrectly found a path between the start node `(0, 0)` and the goal node `(0, 1)`, despite the goal being adjacent to an obstacle. The assertion expected `found` to be `False`, indicating no path should exist, but it returned `True`.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Check Obstacle Handling**: Ensure that the algorithm correctly identifies when the goal node is adjacent to an obstacle and prevents it from being reachable.
2. **Update Pathfinding Logic**: Modify the `plan` method in the `AStar` class to include checks for adjacent obstacles when determining if a path can be found.
3. **Test Edge Cases**: Add additional tests to cover scenarios where the start and goal are adjacent to obstacles to ensure robustness.

Test execution error analysis:
The test `test_goal_unreachable_due_to_obstacles` failed because the A* algorithm incorrectly reported that a path was found (returned `found` as `True`) when the goal was unreachable due to obstacles. The assertion expected `found` to be `False`.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Check Pathfinding Logic**: Review the `plan` method in the `AStar` class to ensure that it correctly identifies when the goal is unreachable due to obstacles. Specifically, verify the conditions under which nodes are added to the `open_list` and ensure that the algorithm properly handles scenarios where the goal cannot be reached.

2. **Debugging Output**: Add debugging statements to log the state of the `open_list`, `closed_list`, and the current node being processed to trace the pathfinding logic during execution.

3. **Test Case Validation**: Ensure that the grid setup in the test accurately reflects the intended scenario, where the goal is indeed unreachable due to obstacles.

**Recommended Fixes:**
1. Remove the `self` parameter from the `test_path_with_obstacles_filled` function definition. Change:
   ```python

   to:

Test execution error analysis:
The test run failed due to an error in the `test_goal_unreachable_due_to_obstacles_filled` test case. The error message indicates that the fixture 'self' was not found, which suggests that the test function is incorrectly defined or is missing the necessary context for pytest to recognize it as a valid test.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Check Test Function Definition**: Ensure that the test function `test_goal_unreachable_due_to_obstacles_filled` is defined correctly. It should not have any parameters unless they are valid pytest fixtures.

2. **Remove Unnecessary Parameters**: If the function is meant to be a standalone test without any fixtures, remove any parameters that are not needed.

3. **Review Class Structure**: If the test is intended to be part of a class, ensure that the class is properly defined and that pytest is aware of it.

4. **Run Tests Individually**: To isolate the issue, try running the failing test individually using `pytest test_app.py::test_goal_unreachable_due_to_obstacles_filled` to see if the error persists. 

By addressing these points, the test should be able to run successfully.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Remove or Correct the Use of `self`:** Ensure that the test function does not reference `self` unless it is part of a class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. If the test is meant to be a standalone function, remove any references to `self`.

2. **Check for Class-Based Structure:** If you intended to use class-based tests, define the test functions within a class that inherits from `pytest` or `unittest.TestCase`.

3. **Run Tests Individually:** If the issue persists, try running the tests individually to isolate the problem further.

By addressing the fixture issue, the test should run successfully.

Test execution error analysis:
The test `test_start_goal_opposite_corners_blocked` failed because the A* algorithm incorrectly found a path between the start node (1, 1) and the goal node (3, 3) despite the presence of obstacles blocking the path. The assertion expected `found` to be `False`, indicating no path should be found, but it returned `True`.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Check Pathfinding Logic**: Review the `plan` method in the `AStar` class to ensure that it correctly identifies when a path is blocked by obstacles. Specifically, verify that nodes representing obstacles are properly handled and not added to the open list.

2. **Boundary Conditions**: Ensure that the logic for checking if a node is outside the grid boundaries and if it is an obstacle is functioning correctly. This includes verifying that the grid is being reset properly before each search.

3. **Debugging Output**: Add debugging statements within the `plan` method to log the state of the open and closed lists, as well as the current node being processed, to help trace the pathfinding logic during execution.

4. **Test Coverage**: Consider adding more tests that cover edge cases, such as different configurations of obstacles, to ensure robustness in the pathfinding implementation.

Test execution error analysis:
The test `test_start_goal_opposite_corners_blocked` failed because the A* algorithm incorrectly identified a path when there should have been none due to obstacles blocking the way. The assertion expected `found` to be `False`, but it was `True`.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Check Pathfinding Logic**: Review the `plan` method in the `AStar` class to ensure that it correctly identifies when no path exists due to obstacles. Specifically, verify that nodes are marked as visited and that the algorithm properly handles blocked paths.

2. **Debug Output**: Add debug statements in the `plan` method to log the contents of the `open_list` and `closed_list` at each iteration to trace how nodes are being processed.

3. **Test Case Validation**: Ensure that the grid configuration used in the test accurately represents the intended scenario where the start and goal are indeed blocked by obstacles.

By addressing these areas, the test should pass as expected.

user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `app.py`.
Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the code coverage report.
Those numbers are not a part of the original code.

### Test Framework
The test framework used for running tests is `pytest`.
If the current tests are part of a class and contain a 'self' input, than the generated tests should also include the `self` parameter in the test function signature.


## Previous Iterations Failed Tests
Below is a list of failed tests that were generated in previous iterations. Do not generate the same tests again, and take the failed tests into account when generating new tests.

```
Test execution error analysis:
The test `test_adjacent_start_goal_blocked` failed because the A* algorithm incorrectly found a path between the start node `(0, 0)` and the goal node `(0, 1)`, despite the goal being adjacent to an obstacle. The assertion expected `found` to be `False`, indicating no path should exist, but it returned `True`.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Check Obstacle Handling**: Ensure that the algorithm correctly identifies when the goal node is adjacent to an obstacle and prevents it from being reachable.
2. **Update Pathfinding Logic**: Modify the `plan` method in the `AStar` class to include checks for adjacent obstacles when determining if a path can be found.
3. **Test Edge Cases**: Add additional tests to cover scenarios where the start and goal are adjacent to obstacles to ensure robustness.

Test execution error analysis:
The test `test_goal_unreachable_due_to_obstacles` failed because the A* algorithm incorrectly reported that a path was found (returned `found` as `True`) when the goal was unreachable due to obstacles. The assertion expected `found` to be `False`.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Check Pathfinding Logic**: Review the `plan` method in the `AStar` class to ensure that it correctly identifies when the goal is unreachable due to obstacles. Specifically, verify the conditions under which nodes are added to the `open_list` and ensure that the algorithm properly handles scenarios where the goal cannot be reached.

2. **Debugging Output**: Add debugging statements to log the state of the `open_list`, `closed_list`, and the current node being processed to trace the pathfinding logic during execution.

3. **Test Case Validation**: Ensure that the grid setup in the test accurately reflects the intended scenario, where the goal is indeed unreachable due to obstacles.

**Recommended Fixes:**
1. Remove the `self` parameter from the `test_path_with_obstacles_filled` function definition. Change:
   ```python
   def test_path_with_obstacles_filled(self):
   ```
   to:
   ```python
   def test_path_with_obstacles_filled():
   ```

Test execution error analysis:
The test run failed due to an error in the `test_goal_unreachable_due_to_obstacles_filled` test case. The error message indicates that the fixture 'self' was not found, which suggests that the test function is incorrectly defined or is missing the necessary context for pytest to recognize it as a valid test.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Check Test Function Definition**: Ensure that the test function `test_goal_unreachable_due_to_obstacles_filled` is defined correctly. It should not have any parameters unless they are valid pytest fixtures.

2. **Remove Unnecessary Parameters**: If the function is meant to be a standalone test without any fixtures, remove any parameters that are not needed.

3. **Review Class Structure**: If the test is intended to be part of a class, ensure that the class is properly defined and that pytest is aware of it.

4. **Run Tests Individually**: To isolate the issue, try running the failing test individually using `pytest test_app.py::test_goal_unreachable_due_to_obstacles_filled` to see if the error persists. 

By addressing these points, the test should be able to run successfully.

Test execution error analysis:
The test run failed due to an error in the `test_start_surrounded_by_obstacles_filled` function, specifically because it attempted to use a fixture named `self`, which is not defined in the context of pytest. This resulted in the error message indicating that the fixture 'self' was not found.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Remove or Correct the Use of `self`:** Ensure that the test function does not reference `self` unless it is part of a class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. If the test is meant to be a standalone function, remove any references to `self`.

2. **Check for Class-Based Structure:** If you intended to use class-based tests, define the test functions within a class that inherits from `pytest` or `unittest.TestCase`.

3. **Run Tests Individually:** If the issue persists, try running the tests individually to isolate the problem further.

By addressing the fixture issue, the test should run successfully.

Test execution error analysis:
The test `test_start_goal_opposite_corners_blocked` failed because the A* algorithm incorrectly found a path between the start node (1, 1) and the goal node (3, 3) despite the presence of obstacles blocking the path. The assertion expected `found` to be `False`, indicating no path should be found, but it returned `True`.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Check Pathfinding Logic**: Review the `plan` method in the `AStar` class to ensure that it correctly identifies when a path is blocked by obstacles. Specifically, verify that nodes representing obstacles are properly handled and not added to the open list.

2. **Boundary Conditions**: Ensure that the logic for checking if a node is outside the grid boundaries and if it is an obstacle is functioning correctly. This includes verifying that the grid is being reset properly before each search.

3. **Debugging Output**: Add debugging statements within the `plan` method to log the state of the open and closed lists, as well as the current node being processed, to help trace the pathfinding logic during execution.

4. **Test Coverage**: Consider adding more tests that cover edge cases, such as different configurations of obstacles, to ensure robustness in the pathfinding implementation.

Test execution error analysis:
The test `test_start_goal_opposite_corners_blocked` failed because the A* algorithm incorrectly found a path between the start node (1, 1) and the goal node (3, 3) despite the presence of obstacles blocking the path. The assertion expected `found` to be `False`, indicating no path should be found, but it returned `True`.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Check Pathfinding Logic**: Review the `plan` method in the `AStar` class to ensure that it correctly identifies when a path is blocked by obstacles. Specifically, verify that nodes marked as obstacles (non-zero values in the grid) are not added to the open list.

2. **Boundary Conditions**: Ensure that the algorithm properly handles cases where the start or goal nodes are surrounded by obstacles, preventing any movement.

3. **Debugging Statements**: Add debugging print statements within the `plan` method to trace the state of the open and closed lists, and the current node being processed, to better understand why a path is incorrectly found.

4. **Test Coverage**: Consider adding more test cases that cover various configurations of obstacles to ensure robustness in pathfinding logic.

user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `app.py`.
Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the code coverage report.
Those numbers are not a part of the original code.

The test framework used for running tests is `pytest`.
If the current tests are part of a class and contain a 'self' input, than the generated tests should also include the `self` parameter in the test function signature.

```
Test execution error analysis:
The test `test_adjacent_start_goal_blocked` failed because the A* algorithm incorrectly found a path between the start node `(0, 0)` and the goal node `(0, 1)`, despite the goal being adjacent to an obstacle. The assertion expected `found` to be `False`, indicating no path should exist, but it returned `True`.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Check Obstacle Handling**: Ensure that the algorithm correctly identifies when the goal node is adjacent to an obstacle and prevents it from being reachable.
2. **Update Pathfinding Logic**: Modify the `plan` method in the `AStar` class to include checks for adjacent obstacles when determining if a path can be found.
3. **Test Edge Cases**: Add additional tests to cover scenarios where the start and goal are adjacent to obstacles to ensure robustness.

Test execution error analysis:
The test `test_goal_unreachable_due_to_obstacles` failed because the A* algorithm incorrectly reported that a path was found (returned `found` as `True`) when the goal was unreachable due to obstacles. The assertion expected `found` to be `False`.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Check Pathfinding Logic**: Review the `plan` method in the `AStar` class to ensure that it correctly identifies when the goal is unreachable due to obstacles. Specifically, verify the conditions under which nodes are added to the `open_list` and ensure that the algorithm properly handles scenarios where the goal cannot be reached.

2. **Debugging Output**: Add debugging statements to log the state of the `open_list`, `closed_list`, and the current node being processed to trace the pathfinding logic during execution.

3. **Test Case Validation**: Ensure that the grid setup in the test accurately reflects the intended scenario, where the goal is indeed unreachable due to obstacles.

Test execution error analysis:
The test run failed due to an error in the `test_path_with_obstacles_filled` function. The error message indicates that the fixture 'self' was not found, which suggests that the function is incorrectly defined as an instance method (with `self` as a parameter) instead of a standalone function.

**Recommended Fixes:**
1. Remove the `self` parameter from the `test_path_with_obstacles_filled` function definition. Change:
   ```python
   def test_path_with_obstacles_filled(self):
   ```
   to:
   ```python
   def test_path_with_obstacles_filled():
   ```

Test execution error analysis:
The test run failed due to an error in the `test_goal_unreachable_due_to_obstacles_filled` test case. The error message indicates that the fixture 'self' was not found, which suggests that the test function is incorrectly defined or is missing the necessary context for pytest to recognize it as a valid test.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Check Test Function Definition**: Ensure that the test function `test_goal_unreachable_due_to_obstacles_filled` is defined correctly. It should not have any parameters unless they are valid pytest fixtures.

2. **Remove Unnecessary Parameters**: If the function is meant to be a standalone test without any fixtures, remove any parameters that are not needed.

3. **Review Class Structure**: If the test is intended to be part of a class, ensure that the class is properly defined and that pytest is aware of it.

4. **Run Tests Individually**: To isolate the issue, try running the failing test individually using `pytest test_app.py::test_goal_unreachable_due_to_obstacles_filled` to see if the error persists. 

By addressing these points, the test should be able to run successfully.

Test execution error analysis:
The test run failed due to an error in the `test_start_surrounded_by_obstacles_filled` function, specifically because it attempted to use a fixture named `self`, which is not defined in the context of pytest. This resulted in the error message indicating that the fixture 'self' was not found.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Remove or Correct the Use of `self`:** Ensure that the test function does not reference `self` unless it is part of a class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. If the test is meant to be a standalone function, remove any references to `self`.

2. **Check for Class-Based Structure:** If you intended to use class-based tests, define the test functions within a class that inherits from `pytest` or `unittest.TestCase`.

3. **Run Tests Individually:** If the issue persists, try running the tests individually to isolate the problem further.

By addressing the fixture issue, the test should run successfully.

Test execution error analysis:
The test `test_start_goal_opposite_corners_blocked` failed because the A* algorithm incorrectly found a path between the start node (1, 1) and the goal node (3, 3) despite the presence of obstacles blocking the path. The assertion expected `found` to be `False`, indicating no path should be found, but it returned `True`.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Check Pathfinding Logic**: Review the `plan` method in the `AStar` class to ensure that it correctly identifies when a path is blocked by obstacles. Specifically, verify that nodes representing obstacles are properly handled and not added to the open list.

2. **Boundary Conditions**: Ensure that the logic for checking if a node is outside the grid boundaries and if it is an obstacle is functioning correctly. This includes verifying that the grid is being reset properly before each search.

3. **Debugging Output**: Add debugging statements within the `plan` method to log the state of the open and closed lists, as well as the current node being processed, to help trace the pathfinding logic during execution.

4. **Test Coverage**: Consider adding more tests that cover edge cases, such as different configurations of obstacles, to ensure robustness in the pathfinding implementation.

Test execution error analysis:
The test `test_start_goal_opposite_corners_blocked` failed because the A* algorithm incorrectly identified a path when there should have been none due to obstacles blocking the way. The assertion expected `found` to be `False`, but it was `True`.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Check Pathfinding Logic**: Review the `plan` method in the `AStar` class to ensure that it correctly identifies when no path exists due to obstacles. Specifically, verify that nodes are marked as visited and that the algorithm properly handles blocked paths.

2. **Debug Output**: Add debug statements in the `plan` method to log the contents of the `open_list` and `closed_list` at each iteration to trace how nodes are being processed.

3. **Test Case Validation**: Ensure that the grid configuration used in the test accurately represents the intended scenario where the start and goal are indeed blocked by obstacles.

By addressing these areas, the test should pass as expected.

1. **Check Pathfinding Logic**: Review the `plan` method in the `AStar` class to ensure that it correctly identifies when a path is blocked by obstacles. Specifically, verify that nodes marked as obstacles (non-zero values in the grid) are not added to the open list.

2. **Boundary Conditions**: Ensure that the algorithm properly handles cases where the start or goal nodes are surrounded by obstacles, preventing any movement.

3. **Debugging Statements**: Add debugging print statements within the `plan` method to trace the state of the open and closed lists, and the current node being processed, to better understand why a path is incorrectly found.

4. **Test Coverage**: Consider adding more test cases that cover various configurations of obstacles to ensure robustness in pathfinding logic.

Short and concise analysis of why the test run failed, and and recommended Fixes (dont add any other information):

system: 
user: ## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a python source file, and a python test file.
Your goal is to generate additional comprehensive unit tests to complement the existing test suite, in order to increase the code coverage against the source file.

Additional guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any key logic or calculations it performs.
- Brainstorm a list of diverse and meaningful test cases you think will be necessary to fully validate the correctness and functionality of the code, and achieve 100% code coverage.
- After each individual test has been added, review all tests to ensure they cover the full range of scenarios, including how to handle exceptions or errors.
- If the original test file contains a test suite, assume that each generated test will be a part of the same suite. Ensure that the new tests are consistent with the existing test suite in terms of style, naming conventions, and structure.

## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `app.py`.
Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the code coverage report.
Those numbers are not a part of the original code.

### Test Framework
The test framework used for running tests is `pytest`.
If the current tests are part of a class and contain a 'self' input, than the generated tests should also include the `self` parameter in the test function signature.

```
Test execution error analysis:
The test `test_adjacent_start_goal_blocked` failed because the A* algorithm incorrectly found a path between the start node `(0, 0)` and the goal node `(0, 1)`, despite the goal being adjacent to an obstacle. The assertion expected `found` to be `False`, indicating no path should exist, but it returned `True`.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Check Obstacle Handling**: Ensure that the algorithm correctly identifies when the goal node is adjacent to an obstacle and prevents it from being reachable.
2. **Update Pathfinding Logic**: Modify the `plan` method in the `AStar` class to include checks for adjacent obstacles when determining if a path can be found.
3. **Test Edge Cases**: Add additional tests to cover scenarios where the start and goal are adjacent to obstacles to ensure robustness.

Test execution error analysis:
The test `test_goal_unreachable_due_to_obstacles` failed because the A* algorithm incorrectly reported that a path was found (returned `found` as `True`) when the goal was unreachable due to obstacles. The assertion expected `found` to be `False`.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Check Pathfinding Logic**: Review the `plan` method in the `AStar` class to ensure that it correctly identifies when the goal is unreachable due to obstacles. Specifically, verify the conditions under which nodes are added to the `open_list` and ensure that the algorithm properly handles scenarios where the goal cannot be reached.

2. **Debugging Output**: Add debugging statements to log the state of the `open_list`, `closed_list`, and the current node being processed to trace the pathfinding logic during execution.

3. **Test Case Validation**: Ensure that the grid setup in the test accurately reflects the intended scenario, where the goal is indeed unreachable due to obstacles.

**Recommended Fixes:**
1. Remove the `self` parameter from the `test_path_with_obstacles_filled` function definition. Change:
   ```python

Test execution error analysis:
The test run failed due to an error in the `test_goal_unreachable_due_to_obstacles_filled` test case. The error message indicates that the fixture 'self' was not found, which suggests that the test function is incorrectly defined or is missing the necessary context for pytest to recognize it as a valid test.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Check Test Function Definition**: Ensure that the test function `test_goal_unreachable_due_to_obstacles_filled` is defined correctly. It should not have any parameters unless they are valid pytest fixtures.

2. **Remove Unnecessary Parameters**: If the function is meant to be a standalone test without any fixtures, remove any parameters that are not needed.

3. **Review Class Structure**: If the test is intended to be part of a class, ensure that the class is properly defined and that pytest is aware of it.

4. **Run Tests Individually**: To isolate the issue, try running the failing test individually using `pytest test_app.py::test_goal_unreachable_due_to_obstacles_filled` to see if the error persists. 

By addressing these points, the test should be able to run successfully.

```
Test execution error analysis:
The test run failed due to an error in the `test_start_surrounded_by_obstacles_filled` function, specifically because it attempted to use a fixture named `self`, which is not defined in the context of pytest. This resulted in the error message indicating that the fixture 'self' was not found.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Remove or Correct the Use of `self`:** Ensure that the test function does not reference `self` unless it is part of a class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. If the test is meant to be a standalone function, remove any references to `self`.

2. **Check for Class-Based Structure:** If you intended to use class-based tests, define the test functions within a class that inherits from `pytest` or `unittest.TestCase`.

3. **Run Tests Individually:** If the issue persists, try running the tests individually to isolate the problem further.

By addressing the fixture issue, the test should run successfully.

Test execution error analysis:
The test `test_start_goal_opposite_corners_blocked` failed because the A* algorithm incorrectly found a path between the start node (1, 1) and the goal node (3, 3) despite the presence of obstacles blocking the path. The assertion expected `found` to be `False`, indicating no path should be found, but it returned `True`.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Check Pathfinding Logic**: Review the `plan` method in the `AStar` class to ensure that it correctly identifies when a path is blocked by obstacles. Specifically, verify that nodes representing obstacles are properly handled and not added to the open list.

2. **Boundary Conditions**: Ensure that the logic for checking if a node is outside the grid boundaries and if it is an obstacle is functioning correctly. This includes verifying that the grid is being reset properly before each search.

3. **Debugging Output**: Add debugging statements within the `plan` method to log the state of the open and closed lists, as well as the current node being processed, to help trace the pathfinding logic during execution.

4. **Test Coverage**: Consider adding more tests that cover edge cases, such as different configurations of obstacles, to ensure robustness in the pathfinding implementation.

Test execution error analysis:
The test `test_start_goal_opposite_corners_blocked` failed because the A* algorithm incorrectly identified a path when there should have been none due to obstacles blocking the way. The assertion expected `found` to be `False`, but it was `True`.

### Recommended Fixes:
1. **Check Pathfinding Logic**: Review the `plan` method in the `AStar` class to ensure that it correctly identifies when no path exists due to obstacles. Specifically, verify that nodes are marked as visited and that the algorithm properly handles blocked paths.

2. **Debug Output**: Add debug statements in the `plan` method to log the contents of the `open_list` and `closed_list` at each iteration to trace how nodes are being processed.

3. **Test Case Validation**: Ensure that the grid configuration used in the test accurately represents the intended scenario where the start and goal are indeed blocked by obstacles.

By addressing these areas, the test should pass as expected.

1. **Check Pathfinding Logic**: Review the `plan` method in the `AStar` class to ensure that it correctly identifies when a path is blocked by obstacles. Specifically, verify that nodes marked as obstacles (non-zero values in the grid) are not added to the open list.

2. **Boundary Conditions**: Ensure that the algorithm properly handles cases where the start or goal nodes are surrounded by obstacles, preventing any movement.

3. **Debugging Statements**: Add debugging print statements within the `plan` method to trace the state of the open and closed lists, and the current node being processed, to better understand why a path is incorrectly found.

4. **Test Coverage**: Consider adding more test cases that cover various configurations of obstacles to ensure robustness in pathfinding logic.

1. **Check Pathfinding Logic**: Review the logic in the `plan` method of the `AStar` class to ensure that it correctly identifies when a path is blocked by obstacles. Specifically, verify that nodes are marked as visited and that the algorithm does not attempt to traverse through obstacles.

2. **Boundary and Obstacle Handling**: Ensure that the checks for boundaries and obstacles are functioning correctly. The algorithm should skip nodes that are out of bounds or contain obstacles.

3. **Debugging Output**: Consider adding debugging statements within the `plan` method to trace the nodes being evaluated and the decisions made regarding pathfinding. This can help identify where the logic is failing.

4. **Test Case Validation**: Confirm that the test case accurately reflects the expected behavior of the algorithm given the grid configuration. Adjust the test if necessary to align with the intended functionality.
