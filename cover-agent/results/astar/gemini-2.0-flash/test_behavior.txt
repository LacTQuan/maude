Test Behavior: Test the Node class's inequality check.

Test Behavior: Test the case where the goal node is not found in the closed list during path reconstruction. This simulates a scenario where the search might have terminated prematurely or an error occurred during the search.

Test Behavior: Test the scenario where a parent node is not found in the closed list during path reconstruction. This can happen if the parent ID is corrupted or the closed list is incomplete.

Test Behavior: Test a grid where the open list becomes empty before the goal is found. This can happen when the path is blocked by obstacles, but not completely blocked as in `test_no_path`.

Test Behavior: Test the make_grid function. Currently, it does nothing, so this test primarily aims to achieve coverage of line 151.

Test Behavior: Test the print_grid function. This test aims to cover lines 155 and 156. It captures the standard output and asserts that the grid is printed correctly.

Test Behavior: Test the print_path function. This test aims to cover lines 163, 164, 165, 166 and 167. It captures the standard output and asserts that the grid with path is printed correctly.

Test Behavior: Test the scenario where no path is found, covering lines 84 and 110.
This happens when the open list is empty and the goal hasn't been reached.

Test Behavior: Test the main execution block (`if __name__ == '__main__'`).
This test aims to cover lines 171, 172, 173, 176, 177, 180, 181, 182, 183, 186, 187, 189, 190, 191, 192, 194, 195, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202, 204.
Since directly testing the main block is difficult, this test mocks the random number generator to ensure consistent start and goal positions, and then asserts that the A* algorithm either finds a path or doesn't, as expected.

Test Behavior: Test the Node.__add__ function.

Test Behavior: Test the scenario where no path is found because the open list becomes empty before reaching the goal.
This test uses a grid with a partial blockage, ensuring the algorithm explores some nodes before failing.

Test Behavior: Test the print_path function to ensure it correctly marks the path on the grid.
This test checks if the grid is modified as expected, with the path cells marked with '8'.

Test Behavior: Test the scenario where the goal is one of the neighbors of the start node.

Test Behavior: Test the scenario where the A* algorithm explores all possible nodes without finding a path to the goal.
This happens when the goal is unreachable but not directly blocked.

Test Behavior: Test the convert_closed_list_to_path function when the start and goal are the same.

Test Behavior: Test the scenario where the goal is surrounded by obstacles, ensuring that the algorithm correctly identifies that no path exists.

Test Behavior: Test the main execution block (`if __name__ == '__main__'`).
This test aims to cover lines 171, 172, 173, 176, 177, 180, 181, 182, 183, 186, 187, 189, 190, 191, 192, 194, 195, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202, 204.
