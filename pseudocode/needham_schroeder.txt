# Symbols:
# X = Department X (initiator)
# Y = Department Y (responder)
# K_X, K_Y = Public keys of Departments X and Y
# K_X⁻¹, K_Y⁻¹ = Private keys of Departments X and Y
# E(P, M) = Encryption of message M with key P

# Step 0: Public keys exchange
# Departments ask each other for their public keys (Department X has the public key of department Y and vice versa)
Exchange: X -> Y : (X, K_X)
Exchange: Y -> X : (Y, K_Y)

# Step 1: Department X generates a unique access token T_X for this session
# Department X initiates the exchange by sending Department Y an encrypted message
# containing X’s identifier and the access token T_X
Message 1: X → Y : E(K_Y, (X, T_X))

# Step 2: Department Y receives the message, decrypts it with its private key K_Y⁻¹
# Y retrieves X’s identifier and access token T_X, then generates its own token T_Y
# Y responds by sending T_X and T_Y, encrypted with Department X’s public key K_X
Message 2: Y → X : E(K_X, (T_X, T_Y))

# Step 3: Department X decrypts the response using its private key K_X⁻¹
# X verifies that T_X matches the token it originally sent, confirming the response is valid
# X extracts T_Y
# X sends T_Y back to Y, encrypted with Y’s public key K_Y
Message 3: X → Y : E(K_Y, T_Y)

# Step 4: Department Y decrypts the final message, verifies that T_Y matches the token it sent
